Strategy


Classic order: Regular onboarding  is made, user got to the analysis big loader, email 1 is sent, and the rest follows.
1-5

	•	1 - is also a sequence of 3 emails (if the user didn’t return to the system).(1-1, 1-2, 1-3)

If didn’t finish onboarding (didn’t get to the big loader) - 1b is sent to prompt user back to onboarding, then 1c (same as 1 but no welcome) replaces 1, and so one
1b (after 1 hour) , 1c,2,3,4,5
 * 1b - has a sequence of 3 emails: (1b1,1b2,1b3)

If competitors has less than X ads (20-40):  
-> 1d - just a welcome.  Mobile view - from wix - deprecated
