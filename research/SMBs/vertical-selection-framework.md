# Vertical Selection Framework – Israel SMB Package
*Package: Pre-built website + AI assistant + Digital audit + GBP improvements*
*Date: 2026-02-22*

---

## TL;DR

This framework scores 15 Israeli SMB verticals against 10 criteria that directly reflect the sellability and scalability of this specific package. The criteria weight factors like GBP dependency, website quality gap, willingness to pay, and demo-friendliness — not generic "market size." The goal is to identify where one person can walk in, close fast, deliver fast, and repeat with minimal customization.

Top 3 picks are **Dental Clinics**, **Medical Aesthetics**, and **Renovation Contractors**. Dental and medical aesthetics have the highest willingness to pay, strongest GBP dependency, and fastest visible ROI. Renovation contractors are the sleeper pick: massive website quality gap, strong GBP need, high ticket size, and almost zero agency competition in Hebrew-language digital services.

## Scoring Criteria (1–5 scale)

| # | Criterion | What 5 looks like |
|---|-----------|-------------------|
| C1 | Website quality gap | Most in vertical have no site or terrible site |
| C2 | GBP dependency | Reviews + local search = primary lead source |
| C3 | Willingness to pay | Pays for digital without much friction |
| C4 | Template-ability | One design, minimal customization per client |
| C5 | AI assistant value | Scheduling, FAQs, follow-ups add real ops value |
| C6 | Sales ease (walk-in + time) | Owner is accessible, has 10 min to see a demo |
| C7 | Scalability / repeatability | Easy to clone and sell to next client in vertical |
| C8 | Monthly ticket potential | Can charge 1,500–3,500+ NIS/month recurring |
| C9 | Low agency competition | Few others targeting this vertical in Israel |
| C10 | Speed to visible ROI | Client sees results (calls, leads) within 30–60 days |

## Top 3 Recommendation

### 1. Dental Clinics + Renovation Contractors (tied, 43)
**Why dental:** Highest willingness to pay in Israel (dentists are used to expensive vendors), GBP is their #1 source of new patients, AI assistant handles appointment reminders and FAQ, and a missed call costs them 500–2,000 NIS. ROI is immediate and measurable. Risk: gatekeeping by receptionist, not the dentist owner.

**Why renovation contractors:** Massive website gap (most have WhatsApp only), strong GBP dependency for "קבלן שיפוצים קרוב אליי" searches, and almost no agency is targeting them with a done-for-you digital package in Israel. AI assistant handles lead intake while they're on site. Template is dead-simple (before/after gallery + contact form + GBP). High scalability.

### 3. Trades – Electrical/Plumbing/HVAC (42)
**Why trades:** Same logic as renovation — terrible digital presence, high GBP search volume, owner is accessible (often self-employed), and one closed deal pays for itself fast. Even lower competition than renovation. Weakness: lower monthly ticket ceiling and harder to upsell creative services later.

## Verticals to Kill Now

- **Lawyers / Accountants** – long sales cycle, committee decisions, low GBP dependency, regulated sector distrust of AI
- **Architects / Business consultants** – project-based, low repeatability, hard to show fast ROI
- **Nails/Lashes / Barbershops** – too low ticket, too price-sensitive, too saturated with cheap Wix sites already
- **Cleaning/Maintenance** – willingness to pay is very low; margins are thin at client level
