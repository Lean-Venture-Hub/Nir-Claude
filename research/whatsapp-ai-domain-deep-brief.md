# Domain Landscape Brief: WhatsApp AI Personal Assistant

**TL;DR:** All 8 target domains are registered/taken. Short meaningful domains in .ai/.app are effectively gone — your strategy should pivot to creative compound names, alternative TLDs (.so, .sh, .bot), or buying off the aftermarket. Budget $70-150/yr for .ai; expect $5K-$100K+ if buying premium aftermarket .com or .ai.

## 1. Best Registrars for Availability Checks

| Registrar | Strength | Notes |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| Namecheap | Best UI, large inventory | Free WHOIS privacy |
| Spaceship | Cheapest .ai ($69/yr) | New from Namecheap team |
| Cloudflare | No upsells, transparent pricing | .ai at $140/2 yrs |
| Porkbun | Cheap renewals, .app/.co | Good for .app ($14/yr) |
| Dynadot | Bulk search tool | Fixed pricing, no surprises |
| Dan.com / Afternic | Premium aftermarket buying | For taken domains |
| Sedo | Largest aftermarket | Negotiation + auctions |

**Best for quick availability checks:** Namecheap multi-TLD search or instantdomainsearch.com

## 2. Trending TLDs for AI/Tech Products (2025-2026)

| TLD | Status | Reg Price/yr | Trend |
|-----|--------|-------------|-------|
| .ai | Top tier | $70-80/yr (Spaceship) | +55% registrations in 2025; 28% of new startups |
| .app | Strong (Google-run) | $14-20/yr | +12% growth; widely trusted |
| .co | Mainstream | $25-35/yr | Established fallback |
| .io | Declining | $30-50/yr | Tech legacy; losing ground to .ai |
| .so | Niche/trendy | $30-50/yr | Minimalist appeal (Notion used it) |
| .sh | Hacker/dev vibe | $30-50/yr | Shell script connotation, dev audience |
| .bot | Emerging | $50-80/yr | Directly on-brand for AI assistants |
| .chat | Relevant | $20-30/yr | Strong signal for messaging apps |
| .space | Cheap/growing | $5-15/yr | +404% in 2025 (low quality signal) |

**Recommendation for WhatsApp AI assistant:** .ai is top choice for credibility; .app is clean and affordable; .chat is highly on-brand.

## 3. Premium Short Domain Pricing (2025)

| Type | Typical Aftermarket Price |
|------|--------------------------|
| 2-letter .com | $500K - $5M+ |
| 3-letter .com | $10K - $500K |
| 4-letter .com (pronounceable) | $2K - $50K |
| 5-letter real-word .com | $1K - $20K |
| 4-letter .ai (premium) | $5K - $100K |
| Real-word .ai (e.g., Fin.ai) | $50K - $1M+ |
| Voice.ai (record sale) | $30M |

New registrations: practically no short meaningful .coms are unregistered. Aftermarket is the only path.

## 4. Tips for Finding Available Short Domains (2026)

- **Combine word parts:** prefix + suffix combos (e.g., "getova", "tryova", "useova") — available .com more likely
- **Invented words:** 4-5 letter pronounceable invented words (CVCV pattern: "kova", "tovi", "nela") — check .ai and .app first
- **Lean TLD strategy:** get [name].ai + [name].app together; skip .com unless budget allows
- **Expiry hunting:** use ExpiredDomains.net, NameJet auctions for dropped domains
- **Domain hack approach:** e.g., nud.ge, pi.ng, get.memo
- **Tools:** LeanDomainSearch, Namelix (AI name generator), Wordoid, DotDB for pattern searches
- **Timing:** Monday mornings when domains drop from expired registrations

## 5. Target Domain Availability Check

| Domain | Status | Evidence | Notes |
|--------|--------|----------|-------|
| nudge.ai | TAKEN | WHOIS: created 2017-12-15; company acquired by Affinity | Active product (CRM tool) |
| kova.app | TAKEN | DNS: NS at googledomains.com | Parked or in use |
| tally.app | TAKEN | DNS: resolves to 165.160.13.20 | Active product (Tally form builder) |
| otto.ai | TAKEN | WHOIS: created 2017-12-15 | Active company |
| dex.app | TAKEN | DNS: resolves to 208.98.40.202 | Active product |
| ping.ai | TAKEN | WHOIS: created 2017-12-16, Namecheap | Registered; unclear if active product |
| memo.app | TAKEN | DNS: resolves; NS at dan.com | Likely for sale via Dan.com marketplace |
| brief.app | TAKEN | DNS: resolves; NS at afternic.com | Listed for sale on Afternic — buyable! |

**Key finding:** `brief.app` and `memo.app` NS records point to domain marketplaces (Afternic, Dan.com) — these are actively listed for sale. Budget $500-$5K range likely.
