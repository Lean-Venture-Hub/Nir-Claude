---

## Category 1 — Human Names
*Short, warm, international. Works as an assistant name without being a clone of Siri/Alexa/Alex.*

| Name | Domain | Rationale |
|------|--------|-----------|
| **Mara** | mara.app | Warm, international, easy in Hebrew and English, feels calm and capable |
| **Remi** | remi.app | Gender-neutral, French/global feel, rolls off the tongue easily |
| **Noa** | noa.ai | Already a common Hebrew name with global recognition, short and clean |
| **Eli** | eli.app | Biblical but modern, works perfectly in Hebrew-English dual contexts |
| **Lena** | lena.app | Soft, trustworthy, European feel — like a brilliant PA you'd actually have |

---

## Category 2 — Action/Verb Names
*Names that hint at what it does. Notion/Slack/Linear energy — doing without saying.*

| Name | Domain | Rationale |
|------|--------|-----------|
| **Brief** | brief.app | Directly tied to the morning brief product; clean, professional, confident |
| **Tend** | tend.app | "To tend to things" — caretaking without servitude, human and warm |
| **Recall** | recall.app | Anchors the memory superpower; smart and slightly elegant |
| **Clear** | clear.ai | Implies it clears your mental load; minimal and authoritative |
| **Handle** | handle.app | "I'll handle it" — the exact energy of a great executive assistant |

---

## Category 3 — Abstract/Invented
*Made-up but pronounceable. Premium feel. No obvious meaning — lets the brand define itself.*

| Name | Domain | Rationale |
|------|--------|-----------|
| **Velo** | velo.app | Speed + motion, invented-feeling but easy everywhere, no baggage |
| **Kira** | kira.app | Sounds like a name but invented as brand, warm vowels, globally friendly |
| **Orro** | orro.ai | Double letters = memorable, short, distinctly brand-able, no meaning to fight |
| **Lyra** | lyra.app | Constellation name, slightly poetic, feels elevated without being pretentious |
| **Mevo** | mevo.ai | Hebrew word for "intro/entrance" but sounds invented globally — dual resonance |

---

## Category 4 — Hebrew-Rooted
*Israeli DNA, internationally viable. Like Waze — you'd never guess the origin unless you know.*

| Name | Domain | Rationale |
|------|--------|-----------|
| **Dor** | dor.app | Hebrew for "generation" — also sounds like "door", clean and rare globally |
| **Kesem** | kesem.ai | Hebrew for "magic" — works phonetically in English, strong brand energy |
| **Zman** | zman.app | Hebrew for "time" — deeply relevant product function, exotic but pronounceable |
| **Alon** | alonapp.com | Hebrew name meaning "oak tree", stable and strong, global feel |
| **Nir** | nir.app | Hebrew for "plowed field / light" — ultra short, rare as a brand, clean |

---

## Category 5 — Minimal/Clean
*3-5 letters. Modern. Memorable. The kind of name that needs no explanation.*

| Name | Domain | Rationale |
|------|--------|-----------|
| **Omi** | omi.app | 3 letters, warm, soft — nothing like a robot, globally easy |
| **Pavi** | pavi.ai | Invented, 4 letters, distinctive without being weird |
| **Kove** | kove.app | Sounds vaguely like "cove" (safe, reliable place) — abstract but evocative |
| **Ryve** | ryve.app | Invented, 4 letters, "thrive" energy without the cliche, clean to spell |
| **Vela** | vela.app | Spanish/astronomical for "sail" / "candle" — brief but elegant, globally soft |
