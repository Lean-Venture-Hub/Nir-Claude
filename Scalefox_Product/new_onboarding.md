 I'm thinking of a way to make our onboarding async. meaning, users will go through company url, suggest comeptitors (will be allowed to skip), select icp, brand page. after this
they will continue straight to the home page while on the background:
1. if they completed competitors -  they wil have the following: 
a. 4 images created with just company info + brand
b. 4 images created with company info + brand + competitors
c. once compeittor analysis is ready - they will be prompted to select effective themes, and then we will auto. create 5 more images according to their selection.
2. if they skipped competitors - they wil have the following:
a. 4 images created with just company info + brand

I'm wondering how to best implement this flow, in the ui.
(e.g they will go to dashboard with chip in the sidebar - generating assets, when the a. is ready - it will prompt a modal - tapping it will take them to the ads studio. 
)

I'm specifically confused about the 3 different asset types and how to present them to the user. if it's needed.. etc..
