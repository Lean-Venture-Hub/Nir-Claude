## Post Variation 1: The Confession + Demo

```
I don't post on LinkedIn.

Never have, really. Always felt like shouting into the void.

But I just made something that changed my mind.

[VIDEO: WebGL shader animation]

This is an animated WebGL shader. A few years ago, this would have taken me weeks to learn, or I'd need to hire a specialist.

Yesterday, I built it in an afternoon. With AI.

I've been in product and UX for over a decade. I've seen tools come and go. But what's happening right now is different.

The barrier between "I have an idea" and "I built the thing" has never been smaller.

I'm not talking about no-code templates. I'm talking about real, custom, beautiful experiences - the kind that used to require deep technical expertise.

Shaders. Animations. Interactions that feel magic.

All suddenly within reach.

This is why I've been building something for the past two years. We're launching soon.

More on that later. For now, I just wanted to share this moment.

If you're a designer or product person who thought certain things were "too technical" - that's no longer true.

The rules changed. And I'm here for it.

## Post Variation 2: The Return

```
First LinkedIn post in... years? Maybe ever?

I'll explain why I'm breaking my silence.

[VIDEO: WebGL shader animation]

I just created this. An animated WebGL shader.

For those who don't know: shaders are notoriously difficult. They require specialized knowledge, math, and a lot of patience.

I have none of those things. I'm a product/UX person.

But I built this in a few hours. Using AI to write the code.

After 10+ years in product, I've never felt this empowered.

The gap between vision and execution used to be massive. You'd sketch something beautiful, then watch it get watered down through technical constraints and resource limitations.

Now? If you can imagine it, you can probably build it.

That realization is why I've been heads-down for 2 years on something new.

We're launching soon. I'll share more when the time is right.

But I had to post this because it feels like a moment.

The creative ceiling just got a lot higher.

Anyone else feeling this shift?

## Post Variation 3: The Observation

```
I've been doing product and UX for over a decade.

I've never posted on LinkedIn about it.

Today that changes, because I need to talk about what I'm seeing.

[VIDEO: WebGL shader animation]

This is a WebGL shader I made yesterday.

Not "designed." Made. The actual code. The real thing.

A year ago, I couldn't have done this. I didn't know shader language. I barely knew what a fragment shader was.

But AI changed that.

I described what I wanted. I iterated. I learned as I went. And now I have this running in an app I'm building.

Here's what I've realized:

The best time to be a product person is right now.

We're no longer limited by what we can personally code. We're limited by what we can imagine.

And imagination? That's what we've been training for this whole time.

I've been building something that leans into this shift. Launching soon.

For now, I just wanted to plant a flag: the rules of what's possible have changed.

If you're in product or design and haven't experimented with AI coding yet - start today.

You'll surprise yourself.

## Post Variation 4: The Short & Punchy

```
10+ years in product/UX.

Zero LinkedIn posts.

Until now.

[VIDEO: WebGL shader animation]

I made this yesterday. It's a WebGL shader - the kind of thing that used to require a graphics engineer and weeks of work.

I did it in an afternoon. With AI.

I'm not a developer. I'm a product person who can now build things I could only sketch before.

This is the moment I've been waiting for.

It's why I've been building something in stealth for 2 years.

Launching soon.

More to come.

## Post Variation 5: The Philosophical Take

```
I've avoided LinkedIn for years.

Not because I had nothing to say. Because I wasn't sure it mattered.

But something happened this week that I need to share.

[VIDEO: WebGL shader animation]

I made this. An animated WebGL shader.

For context: I'm a product/UX person. I've spent 10+ years designing experiences, not coding them.

Shaders were always "someone else's job." Beautiful, but inaccessible.

Until now.

AI didn't just help me write code. It collapsed a skill gap that used to take years to cross.

I'm sitting with what this means.

Every product person who ever felt limited by technical constraints...
Every designer who had to simplify their vision because "it's too complex to build"...
Every founder who couldn't afford a full engineering team...

The game just changed.

I've been working on something that lives in this new world. We're coming out of stealth soon.

But honestly? Even if I wasn't building anything, I'd still be posting this.

Because this moment matters.

The distance between imagination and reality just got a lot shorter.

And I think we're only at the beginning.

## Effective LinkedIn Hooks (Pick Your Opening)

### Pattern Interrupt Hooks
These break expectations and make people stop scrolling.

**1. The Unpopular Opinion**
```
Unpopular opinion: Designers who can't code will outperform developers in 2025.
```
*Why it works:* Controversial, creates debate, people click to see your reasoning.

**2. The Counter-Intuitive Stat**
```
I spent 10 years learning to design experiences. Yesterday, AI made that irrelevant. (In the best way possible.)
```
*Why it works:* Tension between "irrelevant" and "(best way)" creates curiosity.

**3. The Admission**
```
I built something yesterday that I couldn't have built last year. And I'm not a developer.
```
*Why it works:* Humble brag without being annoying. Shows transformation.

---

### Proof-First Hooks
Lead with the result, explain later.

**4. The Demo Opener**
```
This took me 3 hours to build. Not 3 weeks. 3 hours.

[VIDEO]
```
*Why it works:* Specific number + visual proof. People want to know how.

**5. The "Watch This"**
```
Watch this for 10 seconds.

[VIDEO]

Now let me tell you why this matters.
```
*Why it works:* Direct command + delayed explanation = engagement.

**6. The Before/After**
```
2023: "I'll need to hire a shader developer for this."
2025: "I'll do it myself this afternoon."

Here's what changed.
```
*Why it works:* Clear contrast. Relatable for anyone who's felt limited.

---

### Story Hooks
Pull people into a narrative.

**7. The Moment**
```
Yesterday at 4pm, something clicked.

I was building an animation I'd always thought was beyond my skillset...
```
*Why it works:* Specific time = feels real. "Something clicked" = curiosity.

**8. The Realization**
```
After 10+ years in product, I finally understand why this moment is different.
```
*Why it works:* Experience + insight. People trust veterans having epiphanies.

---

### Direct Value Hooks
Promise something useful.

**9. The Discovery Share**
```
I just discovered something that every product designer needs to see.

[VIDEO]
```
*Why it works:* "Discovery" feels fresh. "Needs to see" = urgency.

**10. The Shift**
```
The gap between "I imagined it" and "I built it" just collapsed.

Here's proof.
```
*Why it works:* Universal desire (building what you imagine). Proof = credibility.

## Mix & Match Formula

**Structure:** Hook + Video + Context + Tease + CTA

Pick any hook above, then follow with:
1. **Video** - The shader (let it speak)
2. **Context** - Your background (10+ years product/UX)
3. **The shift** - What AI coding enables now
4. **Tease** - "Building something. Launching soon."
5. **CTA** - Question or invitation ("Anyone else feeling this?")

## Revised Post Using Hook #4

```
This took me 3 hours to build. Not 3 weeks. 3 hours.

[VIDEO: WebGL shader animation]

I'm a product/UX person. I've been doing this for over a decade.

Shaders were never my thing. Too technical. Too specialized.

But yesterday I described what I wanted, iterated with AI, and built this.

No graphics engineer. No shader tutorials. Just a clear vision and a new set of tools.

The ceiling on what product people can build just got a lot higher.

I've been heads-down on something for 2 years. Launching soon.

But even without that - this moment feels significant.

What's the most "too technical" thing you've been able to build recently?
```

- #UXDesign
- #AI
- #BuildInPublic

**Follow-up post ideas:**
