## Context

- Invite-only launch

## Post 1: The Confession

```
I've been lying to everyone for 2 years.

"What are you working on?"
"Oh, just some side projects."

That wasn't true.

I've been building something that I think changes how B2B companies run ads.

Here's the problem I kept seeing:

Marketers spend weeks researching competitors. Analyzing their ads. Figuring out what works. Then more weeks creating campaigns.

Meanwhile, their competitors are already running circles around them.

So I built a tool that:
- Analyzes your competitors' ads automatically
- Extracts what's actually working
- Generates ready-to-launch campaigns in minutes

Not templates. Not generic copy. Campaigns built on real competitive intelligence.

It's called ScaleFox.

We're coming out of stealth today.

But we're doing something different: invite-only.

Comment "INVITE" if you want early access.

First 100 get in this week.
```

---

## Post 2: The Realization

```
2 years ago I watched a founder spend $50K on LinkedIn ads.

The campaigns were... fine. Generic. The same messaging every B2B company uses.

He wasn't dumb. He just didn't have time to research what competitors were doing. To analyze what was actually working in his space.

So he guessed. And burned cash.

That's when I started building.

Today, I'm finally ready to share what I've been working on.

ScaleFox turns competitor intelligence into ready-to-launch ad campaigns.

Not in weeks. In minutes.

You show us your competitors. We analyze their ads, their landing pages, their positioning. Then we generate campaigns based on what's actually winning in your market.

No more guessing.

We're launching invite-only to keep things tight.

Comment "IN" if you want access.

I'll DM the first 50 people.
```

---

## Post 3: The Numbers

```
847 days.

That's how long I've been quietly building something.

Today I'm finally talking about it.

The short version: I built a tool that creates LinkedIn ad campaigns in under 5 minutes.

The real version: I built an AI that turns your competitors' success into your ad strategy.

Here's what it does:
1. Analyzes competitor ads across platforms
2. Extracts winning patterns and messaging
3. Generates complete campaigns ready to launch

No more "let's try this and see."
You're starting with what's already proven to work.

I've been calling it ScaleFox.

We're going invite-only to start. Limited spots.

Drop a comment if you want in.

(After 847 days of silence, feels weird to finally post this.)
```

---

## Post 4: The Hot Take

```
Hot take: Most LinkedIn ads fail because marketers ignore what's already working.

They brainstorm from scratch. Create "original" campaigns. Test endlessly.

Meanwhile, their competitors have already figured out what resonates.

The data is right there. In the ads that are running. The landing pages getting traffic. The messaging that converts.

Why start from zero when you can start from what works?

That's the question I couldn't shake.

So I built the answer.

ScaleFox analyzes your competitors' entire ad strategy and generates campaigns based on their winning patterns.

In minutes. Not weeks.

I've been building this in stealth for 2 years. Today we're coming out.

Invite-only launch. Comment if you want early access.

I'm only letting in people who actually run ads. No tire-kickers.
```

---

## Post 5: The Short One

```
After 2 years in stealth, I'm finally ready to talk.

I built something for B2B marketers who are tired of guessing what ads will work.

It's called ScaleFox.

You input your competitors.
We analyze their ads and landing pages.
You get ready-to-launch campaigns in 5 minutes.

Based on what's actually working. Not theories.

Invite-only launch starts now.

Comment "SCALEFOX" for access.

More details coming. But I wanted to plant the flag today.

The stealth era is over.
```

---

## Post 5a: The Confidence Angle

```
After a few months in stealth, I'm ready to share what I've been building.

Most marketers create ads hoping they'll work.

I built a tool so you can create ads knowing they'll work.

It's called ScaleFox.

Here's how:
- You input your competitors
- We analyze what's already winning in your market
- You get campaigns built on proven patterns

No more "let's test this and pray."
You're starting with confidence.

Invite-only launch. Comment "IN" for access.
```

---

## Post 5b: The Methodical Angle

```
I've been building something in stealth for the past few months.

The problem I kept seeing: marketers treat ad creation like guesswork.

Brainstorm. Launch. Hope. Repeat.

But great marketing isn't random. It's methodical.

So I built ScaleFox.

It analyzes your competitors' ads systematically.
Extracts what's actually converting.
Then generates campaigns based on data, not hunches.

Methodical marketing. Finally accessible.

We're launching invite-only. Comment if you want in.
```

---

## Post 5c: The "AI Does Best Practices" Angle

```
After a few months of building, I'm coming out of stealth.

Here's what I realized:

Most founders know marketing best practices exist.
Few have time to actually follow them.

Competitor research? Takes weeks.
Message testing? Expensive.
Campaign optimization? Endless.

So I built an AI that does it all for you.

It's called ScaleFox.

Feed it your competitors. Get back campaigns built on what's already working in your market.

Proper marketing. Without the busywork.

Invite-only launch starts now. Comment "SCALEFOX" for access.
```

## Post 6: The Encounter (Founder Focus)

```
A few months ago I had a few meaningful encounters with frustrated founders.

Same story every time:

"I know I need to run ads. But I don't know where to start."
"I hired someone. They burned through budget. Nothing worked."
"I don't have time to learn marketing. I have a company to build."

These weren't bad founders. They were busy founders.

Building product. Closing deals. Managing teams.

Marketing was one more thing they didn't have bandwidth for.

A few months later, I built something for them.

It's called ScaleFox.

You tell it who your competitors are.
It figures out what's working in your market.
You get ready-to-launch ad campaigns in minutes.

No marketing degree required. No guesswork.

We're launching invite-only.

If you're a founder who's been putting off ads because it feels overwhelming — comment "IN".

This is for you.
```

---

## Post 7: The Encounter (Marketer Focus)

```
A few months ago I had a few meaningful encounters with frustrated marketers.

The pattern was always the same:

"I spend weeks researching competitors. Then I still have to guess."
"We test 20 variations. Maybe 2 work. Maybe none."
"I know what good looks like. I just can't get there fast enough."

These weren't junior marketers. They were experienced. Talented.

Just exhausted from the endless cycle of guess → test → repeat.

A few months later, I built something for them.

It's called ScaleFox.

It does the competitor research in minutes.
Extracts what's actually converting.
Generates campaigns based on patterns that work.

Not to replace your judgment. To give you a head start.

We're launching invite-only.

If you're a marketer tired of starting from scratch every time — comment "MARKETER".

Let's fix this together.
```

## Post 8: The Encounter (Both Audiences)

```
A few months ago I had a few meaningful encounters with frustrated founders and marketers.

Different roles. Same frustration.

The founders said:
"I don't know marketing. I just need ads that work."

The marketers said:
"I know marketing. I just don't have time to do it right."

Both were stuck.

Founders guessing because they didn't know better.
Marketers guessing because they didn't have bandwidth for better.

A few months later, I built something for both of them.

It's called ScaleFox.

Show it your competitors.
Get campaigns built on what's already winning.
Launch in minutes.

For founders: marketing expertise, automated.
For marketers: the research phase, eliminated.

We're coming out of stealth today. Invite-only.

Comment which one you are — "FOUNDER" or "MARKETER" — and I'll send access.
```

---

## Post 9: The Encounter (Emotional)

```
A few months ago I sat across from a founder who looked defeated.

"We spent $30K on ads. I have no idea if any of it worked."

A week later, a marketer told me:

"I know exactly what we should test. But by the time I research, create, and launch — the window's closed."

Two different people. Same exhaustion.

The founder didn't have marketing expertise.
The marketer didn't have enough hours in the day.

Both were doing their best. Both felt like they were falling behind.

I couldn't stop thinking about those conversations.

A few months later, I built ScaleFox.

It analyzes what's working for your competitors.
Then generates campaigns you can launch immediately.

Expertise for the founder who doesn't have it.
Speed for the marketer who needs it.

We're launching invite-only today.

If either of those stories sounds familiar — comment below.

I built this for you.

## Post 10: AWS Founders Club (The Paradox Hook)

```
The smartest founders I know are terrible at marketing.

Not because they're dumb. Because they're busy building.

a few months ago I realized I am surrounded by brilliant, ambitious people. Funded. Technical. Moving fast.

And almost all of them had the same problem:

"I know I need more marketing channels, but I can't get to it"

These weren't beginners. They'd raised money. Built products. Hired teams.
Some even hired a head of marketing, or payed good money for some fancy agency.. 
and yet, for people who like methods, everything just feel like it's based on hunches. 

So I built something for them.
we later discovered, that it's actually really usefull for marketeers and marekting agencies as well :)

It's called ScaleFox.

We deep dive into your target audience.
We find your competitors.
Analyzes what's already working in your market.
Look at what they are missing.
You get ready-to-launch campaigns in minutes.

a proper methodical best practices based system,
No marketing background required.
Just the results.

Coming out of stealth today. Invite-only.

Comment "SCALE" if this sounds like you.
```

## Post 11: AWS Founders Club (The Question Hook)

```
Why do the best founders struggle with marketing?

I found the answer a few months ago.

I was sitting in the AWS Founder Club, surrounded by some of the smartest, most ambitious people I've met. Backed by top VCs. Building real companies.

And when I asked about their marketing, I heard the same thing over and over:

"We're figuring it out."
"We tried ads. Didn't really work."
"We know we should do more. Just don't have bandwidth."

Here's what I realized:

It's not that founders can't do marketing.
It's that good marketing takes time they don't have.

Competitor research. Messaging tests. Creative iteration.

All the things that separate "meh" campaigns from great ones.

So I built a shortcut.

It's called ScaleFox.

Feed it your competitors.
Get campaigns built on what's already proven.
Launch in minutes instead of weeks.

Founder-grade speed. Marketer-grade strategy.

We're coming out of stealth. Invite-only launch.

Drop "AWS" in the comments if you want in.
```

## Post 12: AWS Founders Club (The Contrast Hook)

```
$10M raised. Zero marketing strategy.

I see it more than you'd think.

A few months ago I was sitting in the AWS Founder Club. Room full of ambitious founders — funded, smart, moving fast.

Product? Dialed.
Tech? Solid.
Marketing? "We'll figure it out later."

But here's the thing: later never comes.

There's always another feature to ship. Another hire to make. Another fire to put out.

Marketing stays on the backburner. And growth stays slower than it should be.

I watched this pattern repeat with founder after founder.

So I decided to fix it.

I built ScaleFox.

It takes your competitors, analyzes what's actually working, and generates campaigns you can launch immediately.

No marketing expertise needed.
No weeks of research.
Just campaigns that work, ready in minutes.

We're coming out of stealth today.

If you're a founder who knows marketing matters but never has time for it — comment "IN".

This is what I built for you.
```

## post 13
The smartest founders I know are terrible at marketing.

Not because they're dumb. Because they're busy building.

A few months ago I looked around and realized something:
I'm surrounded by brilliant, ambitious people. Funded. Technical. Moving fast.

And almost all of them had the same problem.

They knew they needed more marketing channels.
They'd hired heads of marketing. Some paid fancy agencies good money.
But everything still felt like guesswork.

For people who build with method, marketing and specifically ad creation felt like shooting in the dark.

So we built ScaleFox.

Here's what it does:
→ Deep-dives into your exact target audience
→ Identifies your top competitors automatically  
→ Analyzes what's already working in your market (and what they're missing)
→ Generates ready-to-launch campaigns in minutes

A methodical, best-practices system for people who don't have time for marketing degrees.

We thought it was just for founders.
Turns out marketers and agencies love it too.

We're launching with invite-only access today.

If this sounds like you (or your clients),
Comment "SCALE" if this sounds like you.
and I'll share an invite





## Hook Variations (Mix & Match)

**Pattern Interrupt:**

**Curiosity Gap:**
- "2 years ago I watched a founder burn $50K..."
- "There's something your competitors know that you don't."
- "I built something I wasn't supposed to build."

**Direct Reveal:**
- "Coming out of stealth today."
- "After 2 years, it's time."
- "I've been building. Now I'm launching."

## CTA Options

| CTA | Best For |
|-----|----------|
| Comment "INVITE" | High engagement, easy |
| Comment + why you want access | Qualifies leads |
| Link in comments | Lower friction |
| DM me | Personal, higher intent |

---

## Recommended: Post 1 or Post 4

**Post 1** works if you want emotional pull (the "lying" hook grabs attention).

**Post 4** works if you want to lead with value/insight (the hot take positions you as expert).

Both drive to invite-only CTA without revealing too much product detail.
