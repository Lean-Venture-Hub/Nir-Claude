# Scalefox Invite-Only Launch Campaign

## TL;DR
**5-Day Blitz.** Day 1 = ALL channels hit simultaneously (LinkedIn, X, WhatsApp, Slack). Create massive spike, ride the momentum. Invite-only (3/user, dual rewards). UGC + scarcity + FOMO.

---

## Campaign Mechanics
| Element | Details |
|---------|---------|
| Access | Invite-only |
| Invites per user | 3 |
| Reward | Both referrer + invitee get extra credits |
| Goal | Viral spread + waitlist demand |

---

## Current Plan Analysis

### What You Have (Good)
- UGC strategy ("I made this in 5 minutes") - strong proof
- Scarcity posts ("How do I get an invite?") - creates FOMO
- Multi-channel approach (LinkedIn, X, Communities)
- Pre-seeding with influencer lists

### Critical Gaps
1. **No waitlist capture** - people who can't get invite have nowhere to go
2. **No tracking/attribution** - how will you know which channel/person drove signups?
3. **No launch sequence** - everything seems simultaneous vs. building momentum
4. **No founder story** - why are you building this? Personal hook missing
5. **No clear CTA hierarchy** - comment vs. DM vs. link unclear
6. **Community automation risks** - bots can get banned, need human-like approach
