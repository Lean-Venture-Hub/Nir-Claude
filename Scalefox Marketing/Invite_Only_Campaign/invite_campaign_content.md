# 1. Founder LinkedIn Announcement Post

## Real Examples That Worked

### Example 1: Fireflies.ai Founder Story
**Post:** Founders revealed they manually posed as their AI bot "Fred" to validate their product before building it.
**Link:** [Yahoo Finance Coverage](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ai-startups-viral-linkedin-story-112801116.html)

**What Worked:**
- Vulnerable confession ("we pretended to be AI")
- Counter-intuitive reveal that challenged expectations
- Story format with clear beginning, middle, end
- Sparked debate = massive engagement

### Example 2: Superhuman's Waitlist Announcement
**Strategy:** Built 275K+ waitlist through exclusive invite-only access
**Link:** [Superhuman Marketing Playbook](https://druriley.com/superhuman-marketing-playbook-9-strategies-19-examples/)

**What Worked:**
- Flipped the funnel: created demand by limiting supply
- Made users feel special for getting access
- Referrals as social currency
- High-profile early users created aspirational appeal

### Example 3: Clubhouse Coming Out of Stealth
**Result:** 2M users in one week, $4B valuation
**Link:** [Clubhouse Growth Strategy](https://growthmodels.co/clubhouse-marketing/)

**What Worked:**
- Celebrity early adopters (Elon Musk, Oprah)
- Invites sold for $400 on eBay (scarcity proof)
- Each user got limited invites = viral loop
- iOS-only added extra exclusivity layer

### Example 4: Notion 2.0 Pre-Launch Waitlist
**Result:** 20,000+ waitlist before launch, 1M users by 2019
**Link:** [Waitlister Case Studies](https://waitlister.me/growth-hub/blog/case-studies-successful-product-launches-powered-by-waitlists)

**What Worked:**
- Used waitlist period to gather product feedback
- Tiered access created excitement and perceived value
- Built community of enthusiastic early adopters
- Notion AI waitlist later reached 1M signups in 5 weeks

### Example 5: Brian Chesky (Airbnb) Feature Releases
**Strategy:** All feature releases run through founder's personal account
**Link:** [Taplio Best Founder Posts](https://taplio.com/posts/best-founder-linkedin-posts)

**What Worked:**
- Personal accountability: "Here's what WE built"
- Founder as face of product = trust and authenticity
- Direct engagement with users in comments
- OpenAI did same with Sam Altman for Sora launch

### Example 6: Josh Sanders "How to Go Viral on LinkedIn"
**Post:** "How to go Viral on LinkedIn in 2024 (With 9 Live Examples)"
**Link:** [LinkedIn Post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/joshejsanders_how-to-go-viral-on-linkedin-in-2024-with-activity-7150098261490483203-IRrU)

**What Worked:**
- Meta-content (teaching virality) tends to go viral
- Specific number in hook ("9 Live Examples")
- Actionable, educational value
- 87+ comments driving algorithm boost

### Example 7: Artisan AI LinkedIn Ban (Accidental Viral)
**Result:** Lead flow increased after being banned from LinkedIn
**Link:** [TechCrunch Coverage](https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/07/yes-linkedin-banned-ai-agent-startup-artisan-but-now-its-back/)

**What Worked:**
- Controversy creates conversation
- CEO joked "I wish we'd done it on purpose"
- Every post about the ban = free marketing
- Scarcity effect: "banned" = must be interesting

### Example 8: Dropbox Referral Launch
**Result:** 60% increase in signups through viral referral
**Link:** [Viral Waiting List Tactics](https://www.thegrowthlist.co/tactics/viral-waiting-list)

**What Worked:**
- Incentivized referrals (free storage for inviting friends)
- Both referrer and invitee benefited
- Word-of-mouth became self-sustaining growth engine
- Simple, shareable mechanic

## Analysis: What Makes Founder Posts Go Viral

| Element | Why It Works |
|---------|--------------|
| Personal vulnerability | Creates emotional connection, feels authentic |
| Specific numbers | "18 months" "rejected 47 times" adds credibility |
| Counter-intuitive hook | Breaks pattern, forces people to stop scrolling |
| Story arc | Beginning (struggle) → Middle (turning point) → End (lesson) |
| One clear takeaway | Easy to remember and share |
| Implicit CTA | Makes reader want to be part of the story |

## Creative Approaches for Scalefox

### Approach A: The Confession
Reveal something unexpected about the building process. What did you do manually before automating? What belief did you have that turned out to be wrong?

### Approach B: The Rejection Story
How many times were you told "this won't work"? What did people say when you first showed them the idea?

### Approach C: The Obsession Origin
What personal pain made you so obsessed with solving this problem that you couldn't NOT build it?

### Approach D: The Results Reveal
Show concrete outcomes from beta users. Specific numbers, specific transformations.

### Approach E: The Invitation
Frame the launch as welcoming people into something exclusive, not selling them something.

---

## Final Variations (Ready to Post)

### Variation 1: The Builder's Confession

```
I spent 2 years building something I wasn't allowed to talk about.

Every time someone asked what I was working on, I had to say "stealth mode."

Every time I saw marketers struggling to create ads, I wanted to scream "I have the solution."

Every time I watched someone spend 4 hours on a single creative, I thought about what we built.

Today, I can finally talk about it.

Scalefox is an AI creative platform that turns hours of work into minutes.

We've been testing quietly with a small group. The results:
→ 47 creatives produced in one session (usually takes a week)
→ 83% of users said they'd never go back to their old workflow
→ One user called it "the closest thing to having a creative team on demand"

We're not opening to everyone.

We're doing something different: invite-only access.

If you want in, comment "INVITE" below.

First 100 get access this week.

The rest join the waitlist.

After 2 years of building in silence, I'm finally ready to hear what you think.
```

---

### Variation 2: The Pain Origin

```
I used to spend Sundays making ads.

Not because I wanted to. Because I had no choice.

As a founder, I couldn't afford a creative team. As a marketer, I couldn't afford to run campaigns without testing multiple variations.

So I became the "creative person" by default.

Canva tabs. Stock photo hunts. "Can you make the logo bigger?" requests from myself to myself.

8 hours later: 3 mediocre ads that I hoped would work.

That frustration became an obsession.

That obsession became Scalefox.

Today, after 18 months in stealth, we're coming out.

Scalefox lets you create professional ad creatives in minutes, not hours. No design skills. No templates that look like everyone else's. Just tell it what you want.

We're launching invite-only.

Comment "INVITE" if you want early access.

You'll also get 3 invites to share with other marketers who deserve their Sundays back.
```

---

### Variation 3: The Results-First Hook

```
"I made 12 ad variations in 7 minutes."

That was the message from our first beta user.

I thought it was an exaggeration. Then I watched the screen recording.

It wasn't 7 minutes. It was 6 minutes and 42 seconds.

After 2 years of building in stealth, moments like this are why I didn't give up.

Today, Scalefox is officially coming out of stealth.

What is it?
An AI platform that creates ad creatives at the speed you think of ideas.

Why invite-only?
Because we want to onboard people properly, not spray and pray.

How to get access:
1. Comment "INVITE" below
2. I'll DM you a code
3. You get 3 invites to share

When your friends use their invite, you both get bonus credits.

The waitlist is already at 847.

Let's see how fast we can break 2,000.
```

---

### Variation 4: The Counter-Intuitive Take

```
Hot take: Most AI tools make creatives worse, not better.

Generic outputs. Same templates. Zero brand consistency.

I know because I tried them all before building Scalefox.

The problem isn't AI. The problem is treating creativity like a checkbox.

We spent 2 years in stealth mode solving a different problem:

How do you make AI that actually understands what "good" looks like for YOUR brand?

The answer wasn't more prompting. It was rethinking the entire approach.

Today we're coming out of stealth.

Scalefox is invite-only because we're not trying to be everything to everyone.

We want marketers who are tired of mediocre. Who know the difference between "fast" and "good." Who want both.

Comment "INVITE" if that's you.

I'll send you a code and you'll get 3 invites for your team.

Fair warning: I'll be reading every comment and hand-picking who gets in first.

Make me believe you'll actually use it.
```

---

### Variation 5: The Simple Announcement

```
After 2 years in stealth, Scalefox is live.

What we built:
AI that creates ad creatives in minutes.

What makes us different:
It actually looks good. Not "good for AI." Just good.

How we're launching:
Invite-only. You get 3 invites. When friends join, you both get bonus credits.

Why invite-only:
I want to talk to every early user personally. That doesn't scale to 10,000 people.

How to get in:
Comment "INVITE" below.

First 100 comments get access today.

Everyone else joins the waitlist.

Let's go.
```

# 2. Founder X Thread

## Real Examples That Worked

### Example 1: Sam Altman's Launch Tweets
**What Worked:** Short sentences. Big claims. Let the product speak.

### Example 2: Brian Chesky (Airbnb) Feature Releases
**What Worked:** Personal accountability. "Here's what WE built." Thread format with clear progression.
**Link:** [Taplio Best Founder Posts](https://taplio.com/posts/best-founder-linkedin-posts)

### Example 3: Sahil Bloom's Story Threads
**What Worked:** Numbered structure. Each tweet stands alone but builds to a conclusion. Strong hooks.

### Example 4: Notion "Make with Notion" Launch Thread
**Post:** Real-time thread during keynote + follow-up feature deep dives
**Link:** [Notion Twitter](https://x.com/NotionHQ/status/1849496111733698909)

**What Worked:**
- Live thread during event created urgency
- Follow-up threads one week later for specific features
- 5-post thread with clips and screenshots
- Deep dives on single features (e.g., Layouts with databases)
- [Feature Thread Example](https://x.com/NotionHQ/status/1856056457684242830)

### Example 5: Product Thread Template (Rally Blog)
**Framework:** 4-post structure for any product launch
**Link:** [Rally Blog Templates](https://rally.space/blog/product-threads-on-twitter-examples)

**What Worked:**
- Post 1: Hook "New in [PRODUCT]: [BENEFIT] with [FEATURE]"
- Post 2: How it works (10-20 sec clip)
- Post 3: Key detail/highlight
- Post 4: CTA with link
- No more than one CTA per thread

### Example 6: Launch Tweets Collection
**Resource:** Curated collection of all best product launch tweets
**Link:** [Launch Tweets on X](https://x.com/launch_tweets)

**What Worked:**
- Simple announcement format
- Show, don't tell (video/GIF > text)
- Strong visual hook in first tweet
- Clear CTA at end

### Example 7: Stripe Product Threads
**Strategy:** Release overview → detailed follow-ups
**Link:** [Rally Blog Examples](https://rally.space/blog/product-threads-on-twitter-examples)

**What Worked:**
- "Here's three things we shipped today" format
- Links to release notes for depth
- Each tweet = one feature, one benefit
- Professional but not corporate tone

### Example 8: Tweet Hunter Launch Collection
**Resource:** Free database of high-performing product launch tweets
**Link:** [Tweet Hunter Launches](https://tweethunter.io/tweets/launch)

**What Worked:**
- Hooks with specific numbers outperform vague promises by 3x
- Pictures/videos/emojis > plain-text
- Countdown posts build anticipation
- Unique hashtag groups all content together

---

## Analysis: X Thread Best Practices

| Element | Why It Works |
|---------|--------------|
| Tweet 1 = Hook | Must work as standalone, creates curiosity |
| Each tweet = one idea | Scannable, quotable, retweetable |
| Numbers in thread | "5 things I learned" creates clear expectation |
| End with clear CTA | Tell people exactly what to do |
| Personal tone | X rewards authenticity over polish |

---

## Final Variations

### Variation 1: The Problem-Solution Thread

```
Tweet 1:
I spent 2 years building something I couldn't talk about.

Today that changes.

Here's the story of Scalefox (and how to get early access):

Tweet 2:
The problem:
Creating ad creatives takes hours.
Testing multiple variations takes days.
Most marketers become accidental designers.

I was one of them.

Tweet 3:
The obsession:
What if AI could create creatives that actually look good?

Not "good for AI."
Not "template-y."
Actually good.

I had to find out.

Tweet 4:
The result:
Scalefox - AI that creates ad creatives in minutes.

Beta users are making 10-15 variations before their coffee gets cold.

One user: "I can't go back to the old way."

Tweet 5:
The launch:
We're doing invite-only.

Why? I want to know every early user personally.

You get access + 3 invites for friends.
When they join, you BOTH get bonus credits.

Tweet 6:
How to get in:

Reply "INVITE" to this thread.

First 100 replies = access today.
Everyone else = waitlist.

Let's see how fast this thread moves.
```

---

### Variation 2: The Speed Demo Thread

```
Tweet 1:
I just watched someone create 12 ad variations in under 7 minutes.

This used to take an entire day.

Here's what we built (and how to try it):

Tweet 2:
Scalefox.

AI creative platform.
2 years in stealth.
Launching today, invite-only.

Tweet 3:
What it does:
Tell it what you want → Get professional creatives.

No templates.
No design skills.
No "make the logo bigger" internal debates.

Tweet 4:
Why invite-only:

Because I actually want to talk to early users.
Because good onboarding > growth hacking.
Because scarcity isn't a gimmick when you mean it.

Tweet 5:
The deal:

Reply "INVITE" → I send you access.
You get 3 invites for friends.
When they use them → you both get extra credits.

Tweet 6:
First 100 replies get in today.

The waitlist is already at 1,200+.

Your move.
```

---

### Variation 3: The Contrarian Thread

```
Tweet 1:
Unpopular opinion: Most AI creative tools make your ads WORSE.

After 2 years of building, I think I know why.

Tweet 2:
The problem isn't AI.

The problem is treating creativity like a commodity.

Same templates. Same outputs. Same "meh."

Tweet 3:
We built Scalefox to solve a different problem:

How do you make AI that actually has taste?

The answer took 2 years.

Tweet 4:
Coming out of stealth today.

Invite-only because I'm not trying to be Canva.

I want marketers who know the difference between "fast" and "good."

Tweet 5:
Want in?

Reply "INVITE"

You get access + 3 invites.
When friends join, you both get credits.

First 100 replies = today.
Everyone else = waitlist.

Tweet 6:
The goal isn't a million users.

It's a thousand users who can't imagine going back.

Let's start there.
```

## Creative Approaches for UGC

### Approach A: The Time Shock
Focus on how fast it was. "I usually spend X hours. This took X minutes."

### Approach B: The Quality Surprise
"I expected generic AI output. What I got was..." [show creative]

### Approach C: The Workflow Change
"My process used to be [old way]. Now it's [new way]."

### Approach D: The Comparison
Side-by-side of old creative vs. Scalefox creative. Let the work speak.

### Approach E: The Challenge
"I tested if I could create a week's worth of ads in one sitting. Here's what happened."

---

## Final Variations (For Your Inner Circle to Post)

### UGC Variation 1: The Time Reveal

```
I made these 8 ad creatives in 11 minutes.

[IMAGE: Grid of 8 creatives]

Let me put that in context:

Before, I'd spend half a day on ONE variation.
Now I'm testing 8+ before lunch.

The tool is called Scalefox. Just got access through an invite.

Here's the wild part:
You describe what you want.
It actually understands.
The output doesn't look like every other AI-generated ad.

If you're a marketer spending hours in Canva, this changes things.

I have 3 invites left. Comment "IN" if you want one.

Not sponsored. Just genuinely impressed.
```

---

### UGC Variation 2: The Workflow Transformation

```
My old creative workflow:
1. Brief the concept
2. Hunt for stock photos
3. Fight with Canva layers
4. Realize it looks amateur
5. Start over
6. Settle for "good enough"

Time: 4-6 hours.

My new workflow:
1. Tell Scalefox what I want
2. Pick my favorite

Time: 7 minutes.

[IMAGE: Before/After comparison]

I was skeptical. AI creative tools usually suck.

This one doesn't.

Got early access through an invite. Have 3 to share.

Comment "WANT" and I'll send you one. First come, first served.

@Scalefox - you've ruined me for the old way.
```

---

### UGC Variation 3: The Honest Review

```
Okay, I have to share this.

A friend gave me an invite to Scalefox yesterday.

I was skeptical. Another AI tool promising to "revolutionize" creative work. Sure.

Then I tried it.

In under 10 minutes, I created more ad variations than I usually make in a week.

And here's the thing - they're actually GOOD.

Not "good for AI." Good.

[IMAGE: Examples of creatives]

The invite-only thing is real. I got 3 invites when I joined.

Already gave away 2.

If you want the last one, comment below.

Serious only. This isn't hype. This is just... better.
```

---

### UGC Variation 4: The Challenge Test

```
I challenged myself:
Create a week's worth of ad creatives in one sitting.

Usually this takes me 15-20 hours spread across several days.

With Scalefox, I did it in 47 minutes.

47. Minutes.

[IMAGE: All the creatives in a grid]

22 variations across 3 campaigns. Ready to test.

I'm still processing how much time this saves.

If you're running paid ads and making your own creatives, you need to try this.

It's invite-only right now. I have 3 to give.

Comment "creatives" if you want one.
```

---

### UGC Variation 5: The Quality Focus

```
I've tried every AI creative tool.

They all have the same problem: the output looks... AI-generated.

Generic. Template-y. Meh.

Scalefox is different.

[IMAGE: High-quality creative example]

This took me 4 minutes to create.

I could put this in a campaign right now. No touch-ups needed.

The platform is invite-only. I just got access and have 3 invites.

If you're tired of AI that creates "almost good enough" work, comment below.

@Scalefox - Finally, someone got this right.
```

---

# 4. UGC Tweets (X)

## Format Principles for X

- Shorter = better
- One idea per tweet
- Visual proof > words
- Casual, conversational tone
- Hot takes welcome

---

## Final Variations

### Tweet Variation 1: The Time Shock

```
Just made 12 ad creatives in under 7 minutes with @Scalefox

Usually takes me half a day

This is genuinely insane

[VIDEO: screen recording or images]

Have 3 invites if anyone wants to try it - reply for one
```

---

### Tweet Variation 2: The Simple Demo

```
Before Scalefox: 4 hours, 2 mediocre ads

After Scalefox: 10 minutes, 8 solid variations

[IMAGE: grid of creatives]

The hype is real. Got invite access yesterday.

Have 3 invites left. Reply "want" for one.
```

---

### Tweet Variation 3: The Hot Take

```
Hot take: Canva made everyone a "designer" but most of us are still bad at it

@Scalefox actually solves this

Just tell it what you want and get something that doesn't look amateur

Invite-only rn - have 3 to give away. Reply if interested
```

---

### Tweet Variation 4: The Workflow Change

```
My creative process before:
- 2 hours in Canva
- Hate it
- Start over
- Settle

My creative process now:
- Tell @Scalefox what I want
- Pick my favorite
- Done in 10 min

[IMAGE: results]

Have a few invites. Reply for one.
```

---

### Tweet Variation 5: The Genuine Reaction

```
okay @Scalefox might have actually changed how I work

made more ad variations in 20 minutes than I usually do in a week

and they're actually good???

someone gave me an invite and now I have 3

who wants one
```

## Final Variations

### Community Post Variation 1: The Heads Up

```
Hey everyone - quick heads up on something I've been testing.

If you create ad creatives (paid social, display, etc.), there's a new AI tool called Scalefox that's been saving me serious time.

Like, hours per week.

It's invite-only right now but I have a few codes. DM me if you want to try it - not trying to spam the channel, just think some of you would genuinely find it useful.

If you're curious, happy to share what I made with it too.
```

---

### Community Post Variation 2: The Direct Offer

```
Heads up for marketers here:

Scalefox just came out of stealth - it's an AI creative tool that actually produces good output (not the usual generic AI stuff).

I have access and got 3 invite codes.

First 3 people to DM me get them.

The invite also gives YOU 3 codes to share, and you both get bonus credits when someone uses your invite.

Figured I'd share here before posting anywhere else.
```

---

### Community Post Variation 3: The Show-Don't-Tell

```
[IMAGE: Grid of creatives]

Made these in about 15 minutes with Scalefox.

Usually this would take me a full day.

If anyone wants to try it - it's invite only but I have a few codes. DM me.

Not affiliated, just impressed and figured people here would appreciate it.

### Community Post Variation 4: The Casual Share

```
Anyone here create their own ad creatives?

Just got access to Scalefox (new AI tool, invite-only) and it's genuinely saving me hours.

I was skeptical because most AI creative tools produce garbage. This one's different.

Have a few invite codes if anyone wants to test it. DM me.
```

### Community Post Variation 5: The Community-Specific

```
Sharing this with the group because I know how much time we all spend on creative work.

Scalefox is coming out of stealth today. AI that makes ad creatives that actually look professional.

I've been testing it - cut my creative production time by like 80%.

They're doing invite-only launch. I have 3 codes for this community.

Ping me if you want one.

(When you sign up you get your own codes to share too, and you both get credits when someone uses them)

# 6. Scarcity Posts

## Real Examples That Worked

### Example 1: Clubhouse Invite Selling on eBay
**Result:** Invites sold for up to $400 on eBay
**Link:** [Clubhouse Growth Strategy](https://growthmodels.co/clubhouse-marketing/)

**What Worked:**
- 2 invites per user + 10M waitlist = artificial scarcity
- Price on secondary market proved real value
- Media covered the phenomenon = free PR
- "Can't buy it" made people want it more

### Example 2: Superhuman Waitlist Visibility
**Feature:** Users can see who's on waitlist and refer them
**Link:** [Superhuman Inside Look](https://medium.com/dare-to-be-better/superhuman-inside-the-worlds-most-exclusive-app-and-its-ridiculous-onboarding-process-d0ad7a63a64)

**What Worked:**
- Sidebar shows waitlist names, companies, roles, LinkedIn
- Users can hit "Refer" to skip someone to front
- Creates social game around referrals
- Referrals as unpaid affiliate program

### Example 3: Gmail Invite-Only Launch (2004)
**Result:** Became most desired email service
**Link:** [StartupTalky Invite-Only Strategy](https://startuptalky.com/risks-rewards-invite-only-strategy-marketing/)

**What Worked:**
- Positioned as technical limitation (not enough servers)
- Turned constraint into marketing advantage
- People bragged about having Gmail account
- "Insider" status = social currency

### Example 4: Facebook College-Only Expansion
**Result:** Controlled growth, built desire
**Link:** [Viral Waiting List Tactics](https://www.thegrowthlist.co/tactics/viral-waiting-list)

**What Worked:**
- Started Harvard only → Ivy League → all colleges
- Gradual expansion created waves of FOMO
- Each school "opening" was an event
- Non-college users desperate to get access

### Example 5: Commodity Theory in Action
**Principle:** When something is rare, we perceive higher value
**Link:** [Waitlister Psychology Guide](https://waitlister.me/growth-hub/guides/saas-product-launch-waitlist)

**What Worked:**
- Zeigarnik effect: brains prioritize incomplete tasks
- Anticipation activates reward centers MORE than possession
- 68% of people make impulse purchases with limited offers
- Scarcity + belonging = powerful combo

### Example 6: Notion AI Waitlist
**Result:** 1 million signups in 5 weeks
**Link:** [Waitlister Case Studies](https://waitlister.me/growth-hub/blog/case-studies-successful-product-launches-powered-by-waitlists)

**What Worked:**
- AI hype + waitlist = explosive demand
- Used feedback to pivot pricing strategy
- Discovered users wanted revision, not generation
- Single insight saved from bad pricing launch

### Example 7: "How Do I Get an Invite?" Third-Party Posts
**Strategy:** Allies post asking for access, creates social proof
**Link:** [Clubhouse Illusion of Exclusivity](https://dandesim.medium.com/creating-the-illusion-of-exclusivity-the-story-of-clubhouse-9c18d96c8e06)

**What Worked:**
- Third party asking = more credible than brand saying "we're popular"
- Creates conversation in comments
- Others reply "I want one too!" = viral effect
- Positions product as thing everyone wants

### Example 8: Waitlist Position Gamification
**Feature:** "You're #4,521 in line - share to move up"
**Link:** [Flowjam Waitlist Examples](https://www.flowjam.com/blog/waitlist-landing-page-examples-10-high-converting-pre-launch-designs-how-to-build-yours)

**What Worked:**
- Specific number feels real and urgent
- "Share to move up" incentivizes viral spread
- Weekly "top of waitlist gets instant access"
- Turns waiting into a game

## Principles That Work

| Tactic | Why It Works |
|--------|--------------|
| Specific numbers | "Only 23 invites left" > "limited spots" |
| Time pressure | "Closing this batch Friday" |
| Social proof | "847 people waiting" |
| Third-party asking | "How do I get an invite?" posts |

## Final Variations

### Scarcity Post 1: The Number Update

```
Quick update on Scalefox:

We've sent out 412 invites since yesterday.

Waitlist is now at 2,847.

Each user only gets 3 invites.

So they're becoming currency.

If you know someone who has access, now's the time to ask.

If you don't - waitlist link is in comments.
```

---

### Scarcity Post 2: The "Asking for a Friend"

```
Seeing everyone posting about Scalefox.

How do I actually get an invite?

Tried signing up but it says invite-only.

Does anyone have one to spare?

[This is for allies/inner circle to post to create demand]
```

---

### Scarcity Post 3: The FOMO Creator

```
Okay the Scalefox FOMO is hitting.

Seeing all these marketers posting their creatives made in 5-10 minutes.

Meanwhile I'm over here still using my old 3-hour Canva workflow.

If anyone has an invite code they're not using... I'm here.
```

---

### Scarcity Post 4: The Countdown

```
Last call:

We're closing this round of Scalefox invites on Friday.

After that, everyone goes to waitlist until we're ready for the next batch.

Current stats:
- 673 users invited
- 2,019 invites distributed
- 4,847 on waitlist

If you have an invite code and haven't used it, now's the time.

If you need one, comment below and someone might share.
```

---

### Scarcity Post 5: The Value Proof

```
Wild stat:

Scalefox invites are getting traded in DMs.

Saw someone offer $50 for one.

(Please don't do that - just ask nicely and users will share)

Reminds me of early Clubhouse and Superhuman days.

For context: Superhuman invites were selling for $400 on eBay.

Not saying we're there. But the demand is real.

If you're on the waitlist, sit tight. We're expanding soon.
```
