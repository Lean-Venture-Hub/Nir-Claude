# Dental Clinic Value Creation from Public Data — Action Summary

**TL;DR:** 115K dental practices in US, $800K-$2M revenue each. Software market is a fortress (Dentrix/Eaglesoft). But services play using public data bypasses the moat entirely. 78% of local SEO depends on just 3 things (GBP, backlinks, reviews) — all auditable from public data.

## The Opportunity

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| US dental practices | 115,000 |
| Avg revenue | $800K-$2M |
| US dental services market (2026) | $185B |
| Solo practices | 55.7% of market |
| DSO growth | 23% → 39% (2022-2026) |
| Practices failing Core Web Vitals | 70%+ |
| Practices with NAP inconsistencies | 85% |
| Practices not responding to reviews | 90%+ |
| Mobile dental searches | 68% |
| Practices without online booking | 70% |

**Translation:** Most dental practices have terrible digital presence and don't know it. Public data proves it.
