# Lost Revenue Report – Design Spec

## 1. REPORT FORMAT

**Structure:**
1. Cover + Page 1 (90% of value)
2. Page 2 (proof/detail if they're hooked)
3. Page 3 (solution preview + CTA)

**Page 1 Hierarchy:**
- Headline: 1 line, specific dollar loss
- Subhead: Their clinic name + comparison trigger
- Visual: Single high-impact chart
- 3 bullet findings (dollar amounts)
- Micro-CTA: "See full breakdown →"

**Visual Principles:**
- Red for losses (bleeding money visual language)
- Green for competitor wins (triggers envy/FOMO)
- Side-by-side comparison bars (them vs. top competitor)
- Use ₪ symbols, not just numbers
- White space = premium feel (not cheap marketing)

**Length:** 3 pages maximum
- Page 1: Does all the work
- Page 2: Proves you did homework
- Page 3: Easy yes CTA

**Format:** Interactive PDF (clickable, trackable)
- Primary: PDF sent via email/WhatsApp
- Backup: Private web page (tracks if they view it, time spent)
- NO video (too much commitment upfront)

## 2. TIME TO WOW FRAMEWORK

**Definition:**
The elapsed seconds from first visual contact to "I need this person's phone number."

**Target Time to Wow:** 8-12 seconds
- 0-3 sec: Headline grabs (specific $ amount)
- 4-6 sec: Chart registers (visual gap vs competitor)
- 7-8 sec: First bullet lands (their exact problem)
- 9-12 sec: "How did they know this?" moment

**Wow Creation Formula:**
Specificity × Personalization × Gap × Urgency = Wow

**Compression Tactics:**
1. Use their exact clinic name in headline
2. Show ONE massive number (total monthly loss)
3. Name their biggest competitor specifically
4. Reference their actual neighborhood/city
5. Date-stamp the data ("analyzed Feb 2026")

**The Sequence:**

HOOK: "₪47,000/month leaving [Clinic Name]"

PROOF: Chart showing them vs. [Specific Competitor Name] 200m away

GAP: "You have 94 reviews. They have 347. That's 18 patients/month to them."

DOLLAR AMOUNT: "At ₪2,611/patient average = ₪47,000 monthly to competitor"

CTA: "Free 15-min breakdown call this week"

**Headline Formula:**
"₪[Specific Amount]/[Timeframe] Leaving [Their Clinic Name], [Specific Location]"

**Money Shot:**
The yearly extrapolation: ₪564,000
(Always show monthly AND yearly — yearly hits harder)

**Competitor Element:**
Name them specifically. Use their actual name, not "a competitor."
"While Dr. [Name] Dental Center captures patients 200m away"

**Loss Figure Calculation:**
- Average treatment value (industry avg ₪2,611)
- Patient gap per month (calculable from review velocity)
- Monthly loss × 12 = yearly number

**"But Wait" Hook:**
"Page 2 shows the 4 quick fixes that recover 60% of this."

**CTA:**
"Book your free 15-minute breakdown: [Calendar Link]"
(Calendar link = lower friction than "reply to this email")

## 4. THE 5 MOST CAPTIVATING DATA POINTS

### RANK 1: The Review Gap (Emotional Impact: 10/10)

**Finding:**
"You have 94 Google reviews. [Competitor Name] 200 meters away has 347 reviews and gets 73% of 'dentist near me' searches in [neighborhood]."

**Impact Phrasing:**
"Every 10 reviews = 3 new patients monthly. You're 253 reviews behind = losing 76 patients/year to them."

**Psychology:**
Reviews = social proof. This triggers:
- Envy (they're winning)
- Regret (I should have asked for reviews)
- Urgency (gap is widening daily)
- Hope (fixable problem)

**Data Source:**
- Google Business Profile (review count, public)
- Local search simulator (BrightLocal, GMB Everywhere)
- Review velocity tracker (reviews/month)

### RANK 2: The Website Speed Tax (Impact: 9/10)

**Finding:**
"Your website loads in 8.2 seconds. 67% of visitors leave before it loads. That's ₪8,900/month in bounced traffic."

**Impact Phrasing:**
"Every second over 3s = 11% more people leave. You're 5.2 seconds too slow. That's 57% of visitors gone before they see your phone number."

**Psychology:**
- Concrete problem (slow site)
- Hidden cost (they didn't know)
- Technical credibility (you measured it)
- Quick fix perception (speed is fixable)

**Data Source:**
- Google PageSpeed Insights (free, public)
- GTmetrix (free tier)
- Website traffic estimator (SimilarWeb, Ahrefs free)

### RANK 3: The Ghost Clinic Effect (Impact: 9/10)

**Finding:**
"Your last Google Business post: 127 days ago. Your last website update: 14 months ago. Google thinks you're closed."

**Impact Phrasing:**
"Inactive = invisible. Competitors posting 2x/week get shown 8x more often in local search. You're paying the ghost penalty: ₪12,000/month."

**Psychology:**
- Shame (I've been lazy)
- Fear (Google is punishing me?)
- Revelation (I didn't know this mattered)
- Simple fix (just post more)

**Data Source:**
- Google Business Profile (last post date, public)
- Website header/footer dates
- Archive.org (last update timestamp)

### RANK 4: The Keyword Blackout (Impact: 8/10)

**Finding:**
"You rank for 12 keywords. [Competitor] ranks for 183 keywords. You're invisible for 'teeth whitening [city]' (₪4,200 avg treatment, 240 searches/month)."

**Impact Phrasing:**
"High-value searches you're missing: Invisalign [city], teeth whitening [city], emergency dentist [city]. Combined = ₪18,000/month in treatments you could close."

**Psychology:**
- Discovery (I didn't know people search this)
- Opportunity (these are MY services)
- Competitor anger (they're stealing MY patients)
- Money left on table (specific treatments)

**Data Source:**
- Ahrefs free keyword checker
- Google Keyword Planner (free with ads account)
- Ubersuggest (limited free)
- Manual Google search (see who ranks)

### RANK 5: The Ad Spend Blindspot (Impact: 7/10)

**Finding:**
"[Competitor Name] runs 4 active Google Ads for 'dentist [city]'. You run 0. They're buying your patients for ₪23/click while you sleep."

**Impact Phrasing:**
"They spend ₪6,900/month on ads in your area. Every click is a patient who COULD have called you. Estimated return: ₪31,000/month."

**Psychology:**
- Unfair advantage (they're cheating with money)
- Asymmetric warfare (I'm bringing a knife to a gunfight)
- Tactical envy (I could do that too)
- ROI clarity (₪6,900 spend = ₪31,000 return)

**Data Source:**
- Meta Ad Library (Facebook/Instagram ads, public)
- Google Ads Transparency Center (public)
- SEMrush free tool (limited)
- Manual observation (search their keywords, see ads)

## 5. DELIVERY MECHANISM

### EMAIL SUBJECT LINES (Ranked)

**#1: "₪564,000 leaving [Clinic Name] this year – full breakdown attached"**
Why: Specific dollar + their name + promise of proof

**#2: "[Competitor Name] is taking 18 patients/month from you (here's how)"**
Why: Names the enemy + specific number + teaser

**#3: "Dr. [Last Name] – analyzed your clinic vs. [Competitor], found ₪47K monthly gap"**
Why: Personal + analysis frame + dollar amount

**#4: "Your Google ranking costs you ₪47,000/month (free report inside)"**
Why: Specific problem + dollar + free value

**#5: "Why [Competitor Name] gets 73% of 'dentist [city]' searches (and you get 4%)"**
Why: Percentage gap creates curiosity + competition

### WHATSAPP MESSAGE (Primary for Israel)

```
שלום ד"ר [Last Name],

ניתחתי את המרפאה שלך מול [Competitor Name] בגוגל.

מצאתי פער של ₪47,000/חודש.

הכנתי לך דוח חינם - רוצה שאשלח?

[Your Name]
[Title/Company in Hebrew]
```

**Translation/English version:**
"Hi Dr. [Last Name], analyzed your clinic vs [Competitor Name] on Google. Found ₪47,000/month gap. Made you a free report - want me to send?"

**Why Hebrew + WhatsApp:**
- Hebrew = localization credibility
- Casual tone = not a pitch
- Question format = engagement prompt
- Short = respects their time

### LINKEDIN MESSAGE

```
Dr. [Name],

Saw your clinic on Google - ran competitive analysis vs [Competitor Name].

Gap: ₪47,000/month (review count + website speed + local SEO).

Created breakdown report. Worth 15 minutes?

[Link to calendar]
```

**Why this works:**
- Professional platform = professional tone
- "Saw your clinic" = I did homework
- Quantified gap = credibility
- Time-bound ask (15 min)

### PHYSICAL MAIL (Secret Weapon)

**Package:**
- Cardboard envelope (feels important)
- Printed report on premium paper
- Handwritten Post-It: "Dr. [Name] - thought you'd want to see this. -[Your Name]"
- No business card (yet)
- No branding (yet)

**Why it works:**
- 0.001% of marketers do this
- Tangible = higher perceived value
- Handwritten = personal
- Curiosity (who sent this?)

### TIMING

**Email/WhatsApp:**
- Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday (not Monday chaos or Friday checkout)
- 8:00-9:30 AM (before patient rush)
- 7:00-8:30 PM (after clinic closes, at home)

**LinkedIn:**
- Wednesday-Thursday
- Lunch hour (1-2 PM)
- Evening (8-10 PM)

**Physical Mail:**
- Send Monday (arrives Wed/Thu)
- Handwritten address (not printed label)

## 6. THE ANTI-PITCH

### What This IS NOT:
- A service pitch
- A sales deck
- A "Let me tell you about our agency"
- A templated message

### What This IS:
**A business intelligence alert you'd send to your own brother.**

### The Frame:

**NOT:** "We help dental clinics grow their online presence..."

**YES:** "Found something about your clinic while analyzing [city] dental market. You're losing ₪47K/month to [Competitor]. Here's the data."

### Voice Principles:

**Concerned Colleague:**
- "Noticed something weird about your Google ranking..."
- "Ran the numbers - thought you'd want to see this"
- "Found a gap you probably don't know exists"

**Business Intelligence:**
- Date-stamped analysis ("Feb 2026")
- Competitor-specific (not generic)
- Public data citations ("Source: Google Business Profile")
- No solutions offered yet (just findings)

**Forward-Worthy:**
- Clean PDF (their partner can read it)
- No branding spam
- Objective data
- Professional presentation

### The Anti-Pitch Checklist:

✓ Never say "we offer" or "our services"
✓ No company name in first message
✓ No pricing mentioned
✓ No service descriptions
✓ Don't ask "are you interested?"
✓ Don't use "opportunity" or "help you grow"

✓ DO: Share findings
✓ DO: Name specific competitors
✓ DO: Show your work (data sources)
✓ DO: Offer a breakdown call (not "sales call")
✓ DO: Make it feel like you already did the work

### The Trojan Horse:

This report is a gift that creates obligation.

You spent 30 minutes analyzing their clinic.
You found real problems.
You packaged it beautifully.
You sent it for free.

Now they owe you 15 minutes.

That's where you close.
