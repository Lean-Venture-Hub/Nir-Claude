## Outreach by Segment

### 1 — Leaky Funnel (118)
**Problem:** They invested in digital but their website doesn't convert. Patients search, find them, visit the site — and leave.
**Angle:** "You're losing patients you already attracted."
**Offer:** Free website audit showing conversion leaks. New landing page / website redesign with booking integration.
**Proof point:** Show their Google ranking + reviews vs. their outdated/slow site.

### 2 — Warm Digital, No Proof (85)
**Problem:** Website exists but thin social proof. Few reviews = low trust for new patients comparing options.
**Angle:** "Your website looks good, but patients don't trust clinics with few reviews."
**Offer:** Review generation campaign + social proof widgets for their site. Google review strategy.
**Proof point:** Compare their review count to top competitors in their area.

### 3 — Reputation Rescue (24)
**Problem:** Low rating, almost no reviews. Invisible AND untrustworthy online.
**Angle:** Difficult sell — they may not care about digital, or they're aware and overwhelmed.
**Offer:** Only approach if they have a website. Offer full reputation reset: review strategy + response management.
**Note:** Low priority. Skip unless they reach out first.

### 3a — Reputation Rescue - Some Reviews (16)
**Problem:** Low rating with some reviews — likely a few bad ones dragging the score down.
**Angle:** "A few negative reviews are costing you patients every day."
**Offer:** Review response strategy + campaign to bury negatives with fresh positive reviews.
**Proof point:** Show how a 3.5 vs 4.5 rating affects click-through on Google Maps.

### 3b — Reputation Rescue - High Reviews (71)
**Problem:** Many reviews but still low rating — systemic reputation issue.
**Angle:** "71 people reviewed you. The story they're telling isn't the one you want."
**Offer:** Deep reputation audit. Response strategy for existing negatives. Patient experience consulting. Review generation for recent satisfied patients.
**Note:** Larger clinics here — potentially higher deal value if they engage.

### 4 — Invisible Good (61)
**Problem:** Good clinic, zero online presence. Relying entirely on word-of-mouth.
**Angle:** "Your patients love you but no one can find you online."
**Offer:** Starter website + Google Business optimization. The S4 template package.
**Proof point:** Show their Google Maps listing vs. competitors with websites.

### 4a — Invisible Good - Some Reviews (37)
**Problem:** Good rating, some reviews proving quality, but no website to capture interest.
**Angle:** "You already have proof you're great — you just need somewhere to send people."
**Offer:** Template website with embedded reviews + Google Business optimization.
**Proof point:** Pull their actual 5-star reviews into the pitch.

### 4b — Invisible Good - High Reviews (24)
**Problem:** Excellent reputation with 10+ reviews but ZERO web presence. Biggest missed opportunity.
**Angle:** "You have 20+ five-star reviews and no website. You're the best-kept secret in [city]."
**Offer:** Premium website with reviews integration, online booking, SEO. Fastest ROI — they already have the reputation, just need the funnel.
**Proof point:** Their own reviews. Show what competitors with similar reviews + a website look like.
**Note:** HIGHEST priority. Warm leads, easy close, clear value.

### 5 — Digitally Absent (3)
**Problem:** No rating, no website, no data. May be new, closed, or completely offline.
**Angle:** No outreach. Verify if still operating before any contact.
**Note:** Only 3 clinics. Manual verification needed.
