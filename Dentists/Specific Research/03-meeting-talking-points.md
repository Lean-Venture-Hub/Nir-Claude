# Meeting Talking Points - Dr. Andy Boiangiu

> **Goal**: Blow his mind by showing we know him better than he knows his own digital presence. Lead with respect for his credentials, then show the gap.

## Opening (2 min) — Earn Respect Immediately

**Say something like:**
> "Dr. Andy, before we talk about anything marketing-related, I want to say — I did my homework. You're not a regular dentist. You invented the MBone system, you co-founded the Oral Health Center at Ichilov, you ran the Biomaterials Lab at Hebrew University for 5 years, you've founded THREE medical device companies, and you have a perfect 5.0 rating from every patient who's reviewed you. You're one of the most credentialed implant specialists in Israel."

**Then the pivot:**
> "But here's the problem — nobody searching Google right now knows any of that."

## The "Jaw Drop" Moment (3 min) — Show the Gap

### Talking Point 1: The Untold Story
> "You have 99 Google reviews, 49 Facebook reviews, and a perfect 5.0 on MedReviews — that's 174 reviews across platforms. That's strong. But here's the thing — your landing page says you have '15+ years experience' and '500+ procedures'. The real numbers are 25+ years and THOUSANDS. You invented MBone, you co-founded Ichilov's oral health center, you founded 3 companies. Your marketing is underselling you by 50%."

### Talking Point 2: The Invisible Inventor
> "You INVENTED the MBone system. You founded 3 medtech companies. But if someone lands on your ad's landing page, none of that is there. Your website buries it. Your social media doesn't tell that story. Clinics with a fraction of your experience are positioning themselves better — because they have a content strategy and you don't."

### Talking Point 3: The Multiplier Opportunity
> "You already have a working clinic with great reviews. This isn't about building from scratch — it's about MULTIPLYING what already works. With proper SEO, optimized ads, and your real story being told, we estimate ₪60,000-125,000/month in additional revenue from patients who are already searching for exactly what you offer."

3. **His MedReviews page** — perfect 5.0 from 26 verified reviews
4. **His Instagram** — 124 followers for a 25-year veteran surgeon/inventor
5. **A competitor's social media** — show how someone with 1/10th his credentials has 10x his online presence

## Objection Handling

### "I get patients through referrals, I don't need digital"
> "Your referrals are amazing — 174 reviews across platforms proves that. But referrals have a ceiling. Digital multiplies your reputation to everyone searching, not just people who know your patients personally. And right now, your competitors are outpositioning you online despite having a fraction of your skills."

### "I've tried marketing before, it didn't work"
> "I can see that — you have a landing page running at lp.dr-andy.co.il. But that page says you have 15+ years experience when it's really 25+. It says 500+ procedures when you've done thousands. It doesn't mention MBone, Ichilov, or your 3 companies. The marketing you've had so far hasn't matched your level. We're not selling you as 'another dentist' — we're positioning you as the INVENTOR of MBone, the co-founder of Ichilov's dental center, the professor who trained other dentists."

### "It's too expensive"
> "One zygomatic implant case is ₪50,000-80,000. We need to bring you 1-2 extra patients per month to pay for everything and still profit massively. Given your conversion rate with the free consultation + panoramic X-ray, that's very conservative."

### "I'm too busy already"
> "Perfect. That means we raise your prices. When demand exceeds capacity, you don't say no to marketing — you use it to attract higher-value cases and charge premium rates. Your competitors charge less because they CAN'T charge more. You can."

## Closing Power Move

> "Dr. Andy, you spent 25 years building an incredible reputation. You invented technology, you trained other dentists, you built one of Israel's top oral health centers. Right now, the internet doesn't know any of that. We fix that in 90 days."
