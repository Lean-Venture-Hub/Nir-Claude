# Opportunity & Proposal - Dr. Andy Boiangiu

> **TL;DR**: ₪8,000-13,000/month investment → ₪150,000-750,000/month in new patient revenue. ROI of 10-50x. The gap between his credentials and his digital visibility is the largest we've ever seen in Israeli dental.

---

## The Core Opportunity

Dr. Andy has:
- Perfect 5.0 patient rating
- 3 proprietary medical technologies
- Co-founded a top hospital's oral health center
- 25+ years, thousands of procedures
- Ministry of Health examiner credentials
- International memberships & lectureships

He also has 99 Google reviews, 49 Facebook reviews, and 26 perfect MedReviews — 174 total. Plus a landing page at lp.dr-andy.co.il suggesting he's already investing in ads. But his digital strategy is underselling him massively. **This is the easiest marketing case we'll ever see** — we're not building a reputation from scratch, we're AMPLIFYING an already incredible one that's being held back by mediocre execution.
