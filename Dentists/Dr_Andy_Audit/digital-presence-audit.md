# Digital Presence Audit: Dr. Andy Boiangiu

Dr. Andy is a world-class implant surgeon (25+ years, MBone inventor, Ichilov co-founder, 3 medtech companies) with 174 reviews across Google (99, 4.0★), Facebook (49, 89% recommend), and MedReviews (26, 4.98★). He has presence on every major platform — GBP, Facebook, YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, and runs ads via lp.dr-andy.co.il. The problem isn't missing platforms — it's that everything is under-optimized, his GBP is likely unclaimed, his front office is generating 1-star reviews that tank his rating, and his marketing undersells his credentials by 50%. Estimated revenue leak: ₪70K-135K/month.

**Audit Date:** Feb 16, 2026 | **Data:** 156 scraped reviews | **Score: 4.5/10**

## Review Deep-Dive (174 Total)

### Google Star Distribution (from 78 parsed of 99)

| ★ | Count | % | Takeaway |
|---|-------|---|----------|
| 5 | 53 | 68% | Clinical work praised universally |
| 4 | 8 | 10% | Minor complaints |
| 3 | 2 | 3% | — |
| 1 | 15 | 19% | Almost ALL about front office, NOT Dr. Andy |

### The 1-Star Pattern (Critical Finding)

Every negative review attacks the **front office**, not clinical quality:

| Theme | Example Quote |
|-------|---------------|
| Staff attitude | "יחס של העובדים תת רמה, במיוחד של גילה" |
| Phone hold times | "27 דקות המתנה בטלפון הזוי" |
| Scheduling | "קובעים דברים ולא עומדים בהם" |
| Pricing surprise | "מטעים בפרסום אגרסיבי מטעה, מחירים בשמים" |

**Killer quote:** רונית כהן, 1★: "רופא מדהים, שירות מתחת לכל ביקורת" (Amazing doctor, service below any standard)

**Impact:** Fixing front-office ops alone could push 4.0 → 4.5+. That's the single highest-ROI action.

## The Positioning Gap

| What's True | What His Marketing Says |
|-------------|------------------------|
| 25+ years experience | LP says "15+ years" |
| Thousands of procedures | LP says "500+" |
| Invented MBone technology | Barely mentioned |
| Co-founded Ichilov Oral Health Center | Not on LP |
| Founded 3 medtech companies | Unknown to patients |
| 4 languages (HE/EN/RO/FR) | Not marketed |
| 174 reviews, 4.98 MedReviews | Not displayed anywhere |

He's competing on price when he should be commanding a premium.

## SEO & Keyword Gaps

| Keyword | Searches/mo | His Ranking | Competition |
|---------|------------|-------------|-------------|
| רופא שיניים חולון | 500-1,000 | Not top 10 | HIGH |
| השתלות שיניים חולון | 200-500 | Not top 10 | HIGH |
| השתלות שיניים ביום אחד | 300-700 | Not ranking | MEDIUM |
| שתלים זיגומטיים | 50-150 | Not ranking | VERY LOW |
| שיטת MBone | ~0 | Not ranking | ZERO — he owns this |

Blue ocean: zygomatic implants, MBone, computer-guided bone augmentation — zero competition, only he does these.
