# Dental Clinic Outreach Prioritization

**TL;DR:** The warmest leads aren't the clinics with no website — they're the ones who already invested in a site but aren't converting patients into reviews. 58 clinics have a good website, good rating (4.0+), but fewer than 20 reviews. They already believe in digital, they just need the missing piece. Start there, then expand to reputation rescue and visibility plays.

## The 5 Segments (by pain point)

| # | Segment | Count | Pain Point | Pitch Angle |
|---|---------|-------|------------|-------------|
| **1** | **Leaky Funnel** | 74 | Good site (5+), good rating (4.0+), but < 30 reviews | "You're doing everything right except capturing social proof" |
| **2** | **Warm Digital, No Proof** | 58 | Website + rating 4.0+ but < 20 reviews | "Your website looks great. But 14 reviews isn't enough — let's fix that" |
| **3** | **Reputation Rescue** | 28 | Rating < 4.0 but < 15 reviews (fixable) | "Your score doesn't reflect your actual quality. 10 reviews can flip it" |
| **4** | **Invisible Good Clinics** | 120 | Rating 4.5+ but site score 0-3 | "4.8 stars, but patients can't find you online" |
| **5** | **Digitally Absent** | 153 | No website, no social media | "You literally don't exist online" — coldest lead, hardest sell |

## Why This Order

**Segment 1 & 2 first** because these clinics already *spend money on digital*. They have websites (avg site_score 7.25), some have booking — they believe in it. The conversation isn't "why should I be online?" it's "why aren't more patients reviewing me?" That's a much easier close.

**Segment 3 next** because reputation rescue is urgent and emotional. A dentist with 3.6 stars and 12 reviews *knows* it's hurting them. The fix is fast (generate 10-15 positive reviews) and the result is dramatic. Only 28 clinics, but high conversion potential.

**Segment 4 after** because despite the big opportunity, these clinics chose NOT to invest in digital. Some don't care. Some are old-school. The pitch is compelling ("4.8 stars but invisible") but you're selling to someone who hasn't bought in yet.

**Segment 5 last** — biggest group but coldest. Many may not value digital at all.

## Exclude from Outreach

| Category | Count | Why |
|----------|-------|-----|
| Chains (מכבידנט, כללית סמייל, הכתר, etc.) | 59 | Corporate decision-making, won't respond to cold outreach |
| Non-dental (vets, labs, imaging, lawyers) | 29 | Wrong target — scraped by accident |
| Truly bad clinics (rating < 3.5 AND reviews > 30) | ~35 | Real service problem, marketing won't help |
| Already digitally mature (site 7+, social, booking) | ~100 | Already invested, low need |

## Outreach Data Points

When approaching any clinic, reference specific data:
1. **Their exact Google rating + review count** — "You have 4.7 stars from 23 reviews"
2. **The specific gap** — "Your website doesn't have online booking" / "You have 0 Google reviews this month"
3. **Competitor comparison** — "The clinic 2 blocks away has 180 reviews and online booking"
4. **easy.co.il score** (if available, 72 clinics) — "Your Easy score is 8.4 but you're not capturing that traffic"
5. **Their doctor count** — "You have 6 doctors but only 14 reviews — that's 2 reviews per doctor"
