## Campaign Setup Details (All Tiers)

### LinkedIn Campaign Manager Configuration

**Campaign Group (All Tiers)**:
- Create one Campaign Group per budget tier
- Name: "[Company] - Starter Package - [Month Year]"
- Set total campaign group budget (acts as safety cap)

**Individual Campaigns**:
- Name clearly: "[Objective] - [ICP] - [Ad Format]"
- Example: "Lead Gen - Marketing Directors - Single Image"

**Ad Sets (Within Each Campaign)**:
- Split by ICP or testing variable
- Example: Ad Set 1 = ICP 1, Ad Set 2 = ICP 2

**Bidding Strategy Recommendations**:

**Tier 1 ($1.5K)**:
- Use **Maximum Delivery** (automated bidding)
- Let LinkedIn optimize for lowest cost per result

**Tier 2 ($3K)**:
- Start with **Maximum Delivery** for first 2 weeks
- Switch to **Target Cost** once CPL stabilizes (set target = baseline CPL)

**Tier 3 ($6K)**:
- **Maximum Delivery** for cold prospecting campaigns
- **Target Cost** for retargeting (set aggressive target)
- **Manual Bidding** for ABM (bid 20-30% above suggested)

### Audience Sizing Guidelines

**Optimal Audience Size by Budget**:
- **$1.5K**: 50K-150K (narrow targeting)
- **$3K**: 100K-300K total across campaigns
- **$6K**: 300K-800K total across campaigns

**Red Flags**:
- ❌ Audience < 20K: Too small, will exhaust quickly, high CPMs
- ❌ Audience > 1M: Too broad, wasted spend, low relevance
- ✅ Sweet spot: 50K-200K per ad set for $30-50/day spend

### Ad Format Selection by Objective

**Lead Generation Objective**:
- ✅ Single Image Ads (proven performer)
- ✅ Video Ads (if you have quality video assets)
- ❌ Carousel Ads (lower conversion rates for lead gen)
- ❌ Text Ads (low visibility, poor performance)

**Awareness/Engagement Objective**:
- ✅ Video Ads (highest engagement)
- ✅ Carousel Ads (storytelling, educational content)
- ✅ Single Image Ads (static thought leadership)

**Website Conversions**:
- ✅ Single Image Ads
- ✅ Video Ads
- ⚠️ Requires strong conversion tracking setup

### Lead Form Best Practices

**Form Length**:
- **Tier 1 ($1.5K)**: Use 3-field forms (Name, Email, Company)
  - Goal: Maximize volume, qualify later

- **Tier 2 ($3K)**: Use 4-5 field forms (+ Job Title, Phone)
  - Goal: Balance volume with quality

- **Tier 3 ($6K)**:
  - Cold campaigns: 3-4 fields
  - Retargeting: 5-6 fields (qualify harder)
  - ABM: 6-7 fields (custom questions)

**Form Fields to Include**:
- ✅ Required: First Name, Last Name, Email, Company Name
- ✅ Recommended: Job Title, Phone (optional), Company Size
- ⚠️ Custom Questions: Use 1-2 max (e.g., "What's your biggest challenge?")

**Privacy Policy**:
- Must include link to privacy policy
- Pre-check consent boxes where legally allowed

## Creative Production Guidelines

### DIY Creative Options (Budget-Friendly)

**Tools**:
- Canva Pro ($120/year) - Templates, design assets
- Figma (Free) - Design flexibility
- Remove.bg (Free) - Background removal
- Unsplash/Pexels (Free) - Stock photos

**Design Approach**:
1. Use brand colors + 1-2 accent colors
2. Clean, minimal layouts (avoid clutter)
3. Large, readable text (40pt+ headlines)
4. Single focal point per ad
5. Logo prominent but not overwhelming

### When to Hire a Designer

**Hire if**:
- Budget ≥ $3K tier
- You lack design skills/tools
- Brand guidelines are strict
- Need video production

**Cost Estimates**:
- Freelancer (Fiverr/Upwork): $50-150 per ad design
- Professional designer: $500-1,500 for full campaign set
- Video production: $500-2,000 per video (30-60 sec)

**Budget Allocation**:
- Tier 1: $0-200 creative costs (DIY)
- Tier 2: $200-500 creative costs
- Tier 3: $500-1,500 creative costs

---

## Conversion Tracking Setup

### Essential Tracking (All Tiers)

**LinkedIn Insight Tag**:
1. Install on all website pages
2. Verify in Campaign Manager (Website Demographics should populate)
3. Takes 24-48 hours to start showing data

**Conversion Actions** (set up in Campaign Manager):
- ✅ Lead form submission (auto-tracked)
- ✅ Contact form submission (track via URL rule: thankyou.html)
- ✅ Demo request (track via URL)
- ✅ Resource download (track via URL or button click)
- ✅ Free trial signup (track via URL)

**UTM Parameters** (consistent tagging):
- Source: `utm_source=linkedin`
- Medium: `utm_medium=paid_social`
- Campaign: `utm_campaign=[campaign_name]`
- Content: `utm_content=[ad_variation]`

### CRM Integration (Tier 2 & 3)

**Recommended Integrations**:
- HubSpot (native integration via Campaign Manager)
- Salesforce (via Zapier or native sync)
- Pipedrive, Close, etc. (via Zapier)

**Lead Flow**:
1. User submits LinkedIn lead form
2. Lead syncs to CRM automatically
3. Lead assigned to sales rep (based on territory/criteria)
4. Rep follows up within 24 hours
5. Lead outcome tracked back to campaign/ad

**Why This Matters**:
- See which campaigns generate sales, not just leads
- Calculate true CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost)
- Optimize for revenue, not just lead volume

---

## Optimization Framework

### Week-by-Week Actions

**Week 1: Observation**
- ❌ Don't change anything (need data to stabilize)
- ✅ Monitor daily: spend pacing, impressions, CTR
- ✅ Check: Are campaigns delivering? Any errors?

**Week 2: First Optimization**
- ✅ Pause ads with CTR < 0.3% (if spend > $100)
- ✅ Pause audiences with CPL > 2x target
- ✅ Increase budget on best-performing ad by 20%

**Week 3: Refinement**
- ✅ Add negative exclusions (companies, job titles not converting)
- ✅ Test 1-2 new ad variations based on winners
- ✅ Adjust bid strategy if consistently under/over-spending

**Week 4+: Scale**
- ✅ Increase budget on winners by 30-50%
- ✅ Duplicate winning campaigns with slight variations
- ✅ Expand targeting modestly (lookalike, new titles)

### Red Flags (When to Pause/Adjust)

**Pause Campaign If**:
- CPL > 3x your target AND spend > $300
- CTR < 0.2% after $200 spend
- No conversions after $500 spend
- Audience exhausted (frequency > 3, declining performance)

**Adjust Targeting If**:
- Impressions too low (< 1,000/day with $50/day budget) → Broaden
- CTR good but no conversions → Audience quality issue, tighten targeting
- High frequency (> 2.5) → Expand audience or pause ad

**Creative Refresh If**:
- CTR declining week-over-week (ad fatigue)
- Frequency > 3 and performance dropping
- After 30 days, regardless of performance (proactive refresh)

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Targeting Mistakes

❌ **Targeting too broad**: "All Marketing professionals" (1M+ audience)
✅ **Fix**: Narrow to specific job titles + seniority + company size

❌ **Targeting too narrow**: "CMOs at Series B SaaS in SF" (2K audience)
✅ **Fix**: Expand geography or add adjacent titles

❌ **Using too many filters**: Job title + Skills + Groups + Interests
✅ **Fix**: Use 2-3 filters max (title + company size + industry)

### Budget Mistakes

❌ **Daily budget too low**: $10/day (won't deliver, high CPMs)
✅ **Fix**: Minimum $25/day per campaign, ideally $50+

❌ **Campaign ends mid-month**: Budget exhausted early
✅ **Fix**: Set campaign group budget cap, monitor pacing weekly

❌ **Spreading budget too thin**: 6 campaigns at $10/day each
✅ **Fix**: 2-3 campaigns at $25-50/day each

### Creative Mistakes

❌ **Too much text on image**: Walls of text, tiny font
✅ **Fix**: Minimal text on image, large headlines, primary text does heavy lifting

❌ **No clear CTA**: Image with no direction
✅ **Fix**: Strong, specific CTA (not "Learn More"—use "Get the Guide" "Book a Demo")

❌ **Generic stock photos**: Handshakes, people pointing at laptops
✅ **Fix**: Real product screenshots, authentic team photos, or bold graphics

### Optimization Mistakes

❌ **Changing too much too fast**: Tweaking daily
✅ **Fix**: Wait 1 week minimum before first changes

❌ **Never refreshing creative**: Running same ads for 60+ days
✅ **Fix**: Refresh creative every 30 days, proactively

❌ **Ignoring lead quality**: Optimizing for cheapest CPL only
✅ **Fix**: Track SQL rate, optimize for quality not just volume

## Final Notes

**Patience is Critical**: LinkedIn ads take 2-3 weeks to stabilize. Don't judge performance in first 7 days.

**Lead Quality > Volume**: A $75 CPL that converts to customers is better than a $30 CPL that doesn't.

**Test Continuously**: What works today might not work in 3 months. Always be testing.

**Attribution Takes Time**: It may take 30-90 days from lead to closed deal. Track full funnel.

**LinkedIn is Premium Pricing**: Expect 2-3x higher CPL than Meta/Google. Worth it if your ICP is on LinkedIn.

Good luck with your LinkedIn advertising launch! 🚀
