# Generic Patterns to Avoid

**Purpose**: Database of overused B2B ad patterns that signal lazy creative thinking and contribute to "generic and obvious" ad outputs.

**Usage**: Reference this list when creating concepts (Prompt #14, #22) and generating templates (Prompt #17) to ensure creative differentiation.

## Visual Clichés (10 patterns)

### 1. Corporate Handshake
**Pattern**: Two hands shaking, business people greeting
**Why it's generic**: Universal symbol for trust/partnership with zero differentiation
**Seen in**: 40%+ of B2B service ads
**Replacement**: Show outcome of partnership, not the gesture

### 2. Upward Arrow/Graph
**Pattern**: Growth chart with arrow going up-right, line graphs trending upward
**Why it's generic**: First-thought visual for "growth" or "success"
**Seen in**: Sales tools, analytics platforms, financial services
**Replacement**: Show the mechanism of growth, not just the direction

### 3. Light Bulb
**Pattern**: Incandescent bulb representing ideas, innovation, "aha moment"
**Why it's generic**: Clichéd metaphor for ideation with no brand specificity
**Seen in**: Creative tools, consulting, innovation platforms
**Replacement**: Show the actual insight/idea, not the symbol for having one

### 4. Jigsaw Puzzle Pieces
**Pattern**: Puzzle pieces fitting together or connecting
**Why it's generic**: Overused metaphor for integration/compatibility
**Seen in**: Integration platforms, team collaboration tools
**Replacement**: Show what connects (data, people, systems) actually flowing

### 5. Mountain Climb/Summit
**Pattern**: Person standing atop mountain, climbing upward, reaching peak
**Why it's generic**: Achievement metaphor so overused it's invisible
**Seen in**: Goal-tracking software, coaching, productivity tools
**Replacement**: Show the specific obstacle overcome, not generic "peak"

### 6. Maze/Labyrinth
**Pattern**: Navigating complex path, finding way through maze
**Why it's generic**: Complexity metaphor that doesn't explain the actual complexity
**Seen in**: Simplification tools, navigation software
**Replacement**: Show the actual messy process being simplified

### 7. Key Unlocking
**Pattern**: Key opening lock, unlocking door/vault
**Why it's generic**: "Access" metaphor with zero specificity
**Seen in**: Security tools, membership platforms, gated content
**Replacement**: Show what's behind the door, not the unlocking mechanism

### 8. Bridge Connecting
**Pattern**: Bridge spanning gap, connecting two sides
**Why it's generic**: Connection metaphor so common it's meaningless
**Seen in**: Integration platforms, communication tools
**Replacement**: Show what flows across the bridge (data, people, value)

### 9. Gears Turning
**Pattern**: Mechanical gears meshing, cogs working together
**Why it's generic**: "Efficiency" visual that applies to literally any system
**Seen in**: Process automation, operational tools
**Replacement**: Show the actual system working, not mechanical metaphor

### 10. Rocket Launch
**Pattern**: Rocket launching upward, spaceship taking off
**Why it's generic**: "Fast growth" cliché saturated across all categories
**Seen in**: Startup tools, growth platforms, accelerators
**Replacement**: Show the fuel/mechanism of speed, not just upward motion

## Composition Clichés (5 patterns)

### 11. Center-Logo Lockup
**Pattern**: Logo perfectly centered with tagline directly below, symmetrical balance
**Why it's generic**: Template-default composition with zero creative thought
**Seen in**: 50%+ of low-effort ads
**Replacement**: Asymmetric logo placement, integrate into scene

### 12. Left-Right Split
**Pattern**: Obvious before/after or VS comparison with vertical divider line
**Why it's generic**: When executed predictably (sad left, happy right)
**Seen in**: Comparison tools, transformation stories
**Acceptable IF**: Subverted (unexpected sides, no divider, temporal twist)

### 13. Floating Product Hero
**Pattern**: Product floating on gradient background with subtle shadow, nothing else
**Why it's generic**: Apple-wannabe aesthetic without context or story

## Copy Clichés (5 patterns)

### 16. Question Hook Pattern
**Pattern**: "Struggling with X?" "Tired of Y?" "Ready to Z?"
**Why it's generic**: Formulaic opening that assumes pain without insight
**Seen in**: 60%+ of LinkedIn ads
**Replacement**: State the insight, not the question everyone asks

### 17. Power Words Spam
**Pattern**: Revolutionary, game-changing, industry-leading, next-gen, cutting-edge, innovative

**Seen in**: Category leaders trying to sound important
**Replacement**: Specific claims with numbers, mechanisms, proof

### 18. Social Proof Stack
**Pattern**: "Join 10,000+ companies" as the primary message with logo parade
**Why it's generic**: When it's the ONLY message (not supporting proof)
**Seen in**: Category leaders with weak differentiation
**Acceptable IF**: Supporting a specific insight/benefit claim

### 19. Vague Benefit Claim
**Pattern**: "Work smarter" "Grow faster" "Scale effortlessly" "Boost productivity"
**Why it's generic**: Could apply to 1,000 products; no specificity
**Seen in**: Weak positioning, undifferentiated products
**Replacement**: Quantify the benefit, show mechanism, specify the "how"

### 20. CTA-Only Creative
**Pattern**: Entire ad is essentially "Download Now" with logo, no value prop
**Why it's generic**: No creative idea; just a call to action dressed up
**Seen in**: Lazy retargeting, low-effort campaigns
**Replacement**: Give reason to click; communicate value first

## When These Patterns ARE Acceptable

Some patterns can work IF deliberately subverted or recontextualized:

### Subversion Examples

**Upward Arrow → Inverted**
- Show arrow going DOWN with contrarian insight
- "Everyone's scaling up. We're scaling down to what works."

**Corporate Handshake → Rejected**
- Show hands NOT shaking (enemy creation)
- "We don't do partnerships. We do acquisitions."

**Checklist → Contradictory Items**
- Make checklist items surprising or paradoxical
- "✓ Fewer features ✓ Higher price ✓ More restrictions" (luxury positioning)

**Center Logo → Broken Symmetry**
- Use center-logo template but break it with asymmetric surprise element
- Off-center product intrusion, unexpected scale contrast

**Question Hook → Answered Immediately**
- "Struggling with X? Good. That means you're doing it right." (reframe)

### Quality Test

A pattern is acceptable if:
- ✓ You're using it to SET UP the surprise (then subvert it)
- ✓ The execution is so unusual it doesn't register as the pattern
- ✓ You're deliberately referencing the cliché to make a point
- ✗ You're using it because it's "safe" or "proven"
- ✗ You can find 5+ similar examples in competitor research

---

## Replacement Philosophy

Instead of reaching for these patterns, use this framework:

### 1. Domain Transfer (Analogical Thinking)
**Instead of**: Generic business symbols (handshakes, arrows, gears)
**Try**: Map to different domain (nature, sports, history, science)
**Example**: "Integration" → Don't show puzzle pieces; show ecosystem (mycelium network)

### 2. Mechanism Over Symbol
**Instead of**: Symbol that represents the concept
**Try**: Show HOW it actually works (the mechanism)
**Example**: "Security" → Don't show lock; show the actual threat being blocked

### 3. Consequence Over Benefit
**Instead of**: "You'll be more productive" (vague benefit)
**Try**: "You'll leave work at 5pm" (specific consequence)
**Example**: Time saved → Don't show clock; show founder at daughter's recital

### 4. Insight-Led Visual
**Instead of**: Visual-first approach (what looks good?)
**Try**: Lead with insight; let visual follow naturally
**Example**: "Most breaches come from 3rd parties" → Show Trojan horse at party

### 5. Wrong-But-Right Approach
**Instead of**: First-thought creative (obvious choice)
**Try**: Deliberately choose the "wrong" approach that resolves to insight
**Example**: Productivity tool → Show person doing LESS (not more)

## Audit Questions

Use these to detect generic patterns in your creative:

### The Swap Test
**Question**: If I removed the logo, could this be ANY company in this category?
- **FAIL**: Yes, it's generic (handshake for "partnership," arrows for "growth")
- **PASS**: No, the visual is specific to this product's unique mechanism

### The Stock Photo Test
**Question**: Would a stock photo site tag this with generic search terms?
- **FAIL**: "Business success" "Team collaboration" "Digital transformation"
- **PASS**: Needs specific description tied to unique concept

### The Competitor Prevalence Test
**Question**: Can I find 5+ similar ads in our competitor research?
- **FAIL**: Pattern is saturated in category
- **PASS**: Can't find close equivalents

### The Explanation Dependency Test
**Question**: Does this visual require lengthy explanation to connect to message?
- **FAIL**: Visual is arbitrary; needs copy to make sense
- **PASS**: Visual carries message; copy enhances

### The Timeless Cliché Test
**Question**: Would this visual work on a conference banner in 2010? 2015?
- **FAIL**: It's a timeless cliché (hasn't aged because it was never fresh)
- **PASS**: Feels current, specific to this moment/insight

### The Canva Template Test
**Question**: Does this look like it came from searching Canva templates?
- **FAIL**: Template-thinking, fill-in-the-blanks composition
- **PASS**: Original composition with specific creative direction

## Integration with Creative Workflow

### At Brief Stage (Prompt #14)
- Use "Rare Angles" techniques to avoid copy clichés (#16-20)
- Check hooks against banned phrases list
- Ensure contrarian techniques are actually contrarian (not just reworded clichés)

### At Divergent Concept Stage (Prompt #22)
- Explicitly avoid visual clichés (#1-10) in metaphor selection
- Mainstream pattern recognition should flag these patterns
- Differentiation audit should ensure zero pattern overlap

### At Template Generation (Prompt #17)
- Surprise mandate should break composition clichés (#11-15)
- Check that surprise element isn't just swapping one cliché for another
- Audit should verify no patterns from this list are present

### At Analysis Stage (Prompt #20)
- Originality scoring should penalize use of these patterns
- Generic pattern detection cross-references this list
- Flag any ad using ≥2 patterns as "needs revision"

## Pattern Evolution (Living Document)

As new patterns emerge and become saturated, add them here:

**Emerging Clichés to Watch**:
- Glassmorphism overuse (blurred glass effects everywhere)
- "Person looking at data dashboard" stock photos
- Gradient mesh backgrounds (becoming new gradient overlays)
- "Diverse team smiling at laptop" composition
- 3D geometric shapes floating aimlessly
- Duotone filter applied without purpose

**Threshold**: When you see a visual approach in 20%+ of ads in category research, flag it as emerging cliché.

---

## Success Metrics

**Before** (with generic patterns):
- Ads feel interchangeable with competitors
- Low engagement (scroll-past without pause)
- Weak brand recall (could be anyone's ad)

**After** (patterns avoided):
- Distinct visual identity per concept
- Higher engagement (double-take effect)
- Strong brand recall (recognizable without logo)
- User feedback: "This doesn't look like typical ads"
