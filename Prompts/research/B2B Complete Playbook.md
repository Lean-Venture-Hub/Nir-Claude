# The Complete B2B Creative Playbook
## Strategic Frameworks + Tactical Techniques + Brief Generation

---

## I. STRATEGIC FOUNDATION

### Core Problem
Most B2B advertising suffers from three fatal assumptions:
1. **The Rational Myth**: Decision makers are purely logical
2. **The Safety Trap**: Playing it safe maintains credibility
3. **The Corporate Voice**: "Professional" means boring

**Reality**: B2B buyers are humans first. They want entertainment, inspiration, emotion—just like everyone else.

### The Three Filters (Run Every Idea Through These)

**1. The Competitor Test**
Could your competitor run this ad with their logo? If yes → too generic.

**2. The Ignore Test**
Would you scroll past this in your feed? If yes → not compelling enough.

**3. The Human Truth Test**
Does this tap into a real feeling/frustration? If no → you're selling features, not solving problems.

---

## II. STRATEGIC PRINCIPLES

### 1. Find the Human Truth
Every B2B product solves a human problem or creates a human emotion.

**Exercise**: Complete in 5 ways: "When someone uses our product, they feel ___"

Examples:
- The CTO who can finally sleep at night
- The PM who won't be the scapegoat
- The team that stops playing IT firefighter

### 2. Dramatize Pain or Gain
Don't state benefits. Make people *feel* the problem or *taste* the solution.

**Framework**:
- What's the 2 AM version of this problem?
- What's the worst day without your solution?
- What's the best day with it?

### 3. Be Specific, Not Generic

**Generic**: "Increase productivity"
**Specific**: "Cut weekly status meetings from 4 hours to 30 minutes"

**Generic**: "Easy to use"
**Specific**: "New hires running campaigns by lunch on day one"

### 4. Pick a Lane (Embrace Polarization)
Trying to appeal to everyone → bland and forgettable.

**Your POV Audit**:
- What do we believe that competitors don't?
- What industry practice do we think is broken?
- What makes our ideal customer nod vigorously?

### 5. One Ad = One Idea
Never stack multiple messages. Pick the single most powerful angle and commit.

## III. CREATIVE TECHNIQUES LIBRARY

### A. ANALOGY ADS
**Use When**: Tech features are abstract, product screenshots are boring

**The Problem**: Cloud storage specs make eyes glaze over.
**The Solution**: Find an analogy that makes it instantly graspable.

**Formula**:
1. Identify core benefit (not feature): "Prevents hitting things you can't see"
2. Find natural equivalent: Owls have 360° vision, elephants never forget
3. Create visual connection: Use that ability as your hook

**Examples**:
- Side Assist → Chameleon with eyes on sides of head
- 360° Camera → Owl head turned completely around
- Park Assist → Jigsaw pieces fitting perfectly
- Unused data → Dusty car with "wash me" written on it

**Exercise for Your Product**:
- What does it do that seems abstract?
- What animal/object/situation does this naturally?
- How can you visualize it instantly?

### B. TYPOGRAPHIC ADS
**Use When**: Strong copy, limited budget, need fast turnaround

**Six Techniques**:

1. **Replace Letters with Images**
   - "CLOUD" with actual cloud replacing O
   - "Click" with cursor replacing i

2. **Turn Words Into Shapes**
   - "CORNER" arranged in actual corner
   - "I'M FINE" arranged like drowning person

3. **Create Patterns/Rhythm**
   - "FAST" repeated suggesting speed
   - "More" in increasing sizes suggesting growth

4. **Play with Hierarchy**
   - Make key words physically larger
   - Strike through old way, highlight new

5. **Mimic Textures**
   - Luxury text looking metallic
   - Security text looking encrypted

6. **Use Cultural References**
   - Eye doctor using eye-test typography
   - Dating app using text bubbles

**Quick Process**:
1. Write headline in plain text
2. Find/create supporting image
3. Drop text over image, use blend modes
4. Add texture/effects that reinforce message

### C. SQUARE STORMING (60-Square Method)
**Use When**: Need volume of ideas, fighting creative block

**Process**:
1. Create 60 empty squares (Figma/sketchbook)
2. Fill each in ~1 minute (no overthinking)
3. Categorize: Ship it / Work on it / Maybe / Delete

**Why It Works**:
- First 20 ideas: Obvious (everyone thinks these)
- Ideas 21-40: Interesting (past the obvious)
- Ideas 41-60: Breakthrough (forced to think differently)

**Pro Tips**:
- Do in one sitting
- Use timer for each square
- Mix formats (visual, headlines, scenarios)
- If stuck, force 5 terrible ideas to break through

### D. UNDERSTATEMENT ADS
**Use When**: Category is full of hyperbole

**3-Step Formula**:
1. List overpromises: "Revolutionary! Transform your business! 10X productivity!"
2. Make understatement: "It just makes scheduling less annoying"
3. Combine: "We could say this will revolutionize your business, but really, it just makes scheduling less annoying."

**Examples**:
- "Revolutionary? Nah. Just fixes that one annoying thing."
- "We won't change your life. But your Tuesdays will be better."
- "Sure, we could call it AI-powered innovation. Or just: better search."

### E. [CLICHÉ], BUT [TWIST]
**Use When**: Need memorable headlines quickly

**Process**:
1. Find relevant clichés (ask AI for 200 industry phrases)
2. Add ", but [twist]" to each
3. Polish best ones

**Examples**:
- "Time is money, but meetings are bankrupting you"
- "Revenge is a dish best served cold, but ramen isn't" (delivery)
- "Think outside the box, but inside our template" (design tool)

### F. LEGAL LOOPHOLE ADS
**Use When**: Restrictions become creative opportunities

**Two Approaches**:

1. **Complain About Restrictions**
   - "We'd love to tell you what this does, but our lawyers won't let us"
   - "This ad was censored. Google '[product] benefits' to see why"

2. **Find Workaround**
   - Budweiser: Couldn't show rockstars drinking → Showed Google search terms that lead to those photos
   - IKEA: Couldn't name competitor → "Proudly the 2nd best furniture store"

**Why It Works**: Rebellion + backstage effect + clever solution = virality

### G. HUMOR (10 Comedy Types)

**For Conservative Industries** (Finance/Healthcare/Legal):
- Use: Observational, Wit, Self-Defeating
- Avoid: Cringe, Dark Humor, Slapstick

**For Tech/Startups**:
- Use: Satire, Observational, Self-Defeating, Parody
- Test: Surreal, Dark Humor

**10 Types**:

1. **Surreal**: Absurd situations (Jack in the Box's wearable lunch meat)
2. **Prank**: Fake leaks, unexpected reveals
3. **Satire**: Exaggerate to criticize (Mint Mobile: Satan works for Big Wireless)
4. **Slapstick**: Physical comedy (eating hot peppers while reading ad)
5. **Cringe**: Embarrassing situations (overeager sales rep)
6. **Parody**: Mock industry tropes (cliché tech ads)
7. **Observational**: Everyday humor ("That moment when demo crashes")
8. **Wit**: Wordplay ("Our API: Finally a REST you can rely on")
9. **Self-Defeating**: Make fun of yourself ("Our 2019 UI was... not great")
10. **Dark Humor**: Taboo topics done smart ("Uptime better than your will to live")

**Testing Humor**:
- Makes sense without explaining?
- Makes benefit clearer or muddier?
- 80% get it in 3 seconds?
- Punches up (at problem) not down (at people)?

### H. RHETORICAL DEVICES (24 Options)

Quick reference for making any message memorable:

1. **Personification**: "Technology that listens"
2. **Allusion**: "The Rosetta Stone of data"
3. **Hyperbole**: "The only CRM you'll ever need"

5. **Chiasmus**: "Work to live, don't live to work"
6. **Asyndeton**: "Fast. Secure. Simple."
7. **Alliteration**: "Better business begins here"
8. **Pleonasm**: "Free for free, forever"
9. **Onomatopoeia**: "Click, ship, done"
10. **Dialogue**: "Just works"
11. **Antithesis**: "Small team, big impact"
12. **Oxymoron**: "Seriously fun software"
13. **Paraprosdokian**: "Work smarter, not harder, or just automate"
14. **Anaphora**: "Build faster. Build better. Build with us."
15. **Pun**: "REST assured" (API service)
16. **Rhetorical Question**: "Why settle for good enough?"
17. **Simile**: "As easy as sending email"
18. **Metaphor**: "Your data's command center"
19. **Rhyme**: "Ship it, don't trip on it"
20. **Parallelism**: "For creators who code. For coders who create."
21. **Epistrophe**: "Better tools. Better results. Better you."
22. **Climax**: "Faster. Smarter. Unstoppable."
23. **Understatement**: "Might make Tuesdays slightly better"
24. **Imperative**: "Stop settling. Start scaling."

**Pro Tip**: Combine 2-3 devices for maximum impact.

## IV. BRIEF GENERATION PROCESS

### When to Create a Brief
Before any ad execution. A good brief = efficient execution.

### The One-Sentence Rule
If you can't explain the ad idea in one sentence → it's not clear enough.

### Step 1: Extract the Creative Truth

**A. The Real Problem** (felt frustration, not surface pain)
Examples:
- Feeling behind peers
- Wasting time on invisible work
- Fear of making wrong decision
- Cognitive overload

Format: "The audience feels ___ when ___"

**B. The Enemy** (be explicit)
- A process ("Manual reporting")
- A mindset ("Gut-feel decisions")
- Status quo ("Busy work that looks productive")
- Hidden cost

Format: "Enemy: ___"

**C. The Emotional Win** (not features, feelings)
- Confidence
- Relief
- Control
- Calm
- Status

### Step 2: Choose ONE Creative Angle

**A. Analogy**
"This product is like ___ for ___"

**B. Twist a Cliché**
Take known trope, subvert it

**C. Anti-Ad / Meta**
Acknowledge advertising itself, break expectations

**D. Understatement**
Reduce hype, say less than expected

**E. Enemy-Focused**
Ad isn't about product—it's about destroying the enemy

**F. Visual Metaphor**
Show benefit through unexpected visual

**G. Contrast/Before-After**
Dramatize the difference

**H. Insider Reference**
Use something only your audience knows

### Step 3: Write the Big Idea

**Format**: One sentence that:
- Understandable without product context
- Sparks a visual
- Contains no feature lists

**Example**: "Show a meeting room where everyone's on mute but still talking" (communication tool)

### Step 4: Complete Brief Template

**1. OBJECTIVE**
What this ad achieves:
- Stop the scroll
- Reframe category belief
- Create curiosity for demo

**2. AUDIENCE SNAPSHOT** (one paragraph)
- Who they are
- What they're doing when they see it
- What mindset they're in

**3. CORE INSIGHT**
The human truth.
Example: "Founders don't fear complexity. They fear making a visible mistake."

**4. CREATIVE CONCEPT**
Plain language explanation:
- What's happening in the ad?
- Why is this unexpected?
- Why does this resonate emotionally?

**5. VISUAL DIRECTION**
What should be *seen* (not how to design):
- Metaphors
- Scenes
- Objects
- Contrast ideas

Avoid: Color codes, fonts, UI instructions

**6. COPY DIRECTION**
- Headline intent (not final copy)
- Tone guidance
- What to avoid
- 2-3 sample headline directions

**7. CTA PHILOSOPHY**
- What mental action user takes
- Level of commitment expected

**8. CONSTRAINTS & GUARDRAILS**
- Brand limitations
- Legal/trust considerations
- What breaks credibility

### Brief Self-Check

Before finalizing:
- ☐ Is this idea obvious?
- ☐ Could this belong to any SaaS?
- ☐ Is product the hero or user the hero?
- ☐ Would this stop YOU from scrolling?

If yes to first two → revise.

## VI. CHANNEL-SPECIFIC STRATEGIES

### LinkedIn
**Reality**: B2B's primary channel, incredibly competitive

**What Works**:
- Founder POV (authentic voice)
- Industry hot takes (polarizing opinions)
- Behind-the-scenes (backstage effect)
- Data-driven insights (original research)
- Customer stories (real results)

**Format Priorities**:
1. Carousel (highest engagement)
2. Video (native, <60 sec)
3. Image (if stunning)
4. Text (if insight is fire)

**Copy Style**:
- First line = hook (critical)
- Short paragraphs
- Line breaks matter
- One CTA max

### Meta (Facebook/Instagram)
**Reality**: Cheaper than LinkedIn, broader reach

**What Works**:
- Visual-first (stop the thumb)
- Emotional hooks
- Social proof
- Clear value prop in 3 seconds

**Format Priorities**:
1. Short video (15-30 sec)
2. Carousel (storytelling)
3. Static image (if bold)

### Display/Programmatic
**Reality**: Banner blindness is real

**What Works**:
- Bold type treatment
- Unexpected visuals
- One message only
- Clear brand visibility

**Avoid**:
- Stock photos
- Lots of text
- Multiple CTAs

---

## VII. COPY PRINCIPLES

### Speak Human, Not Corporate

**Replace**:
- "Solutions" → What you actually do
- "Leverage" → Use
- "Best-in-class" → Specific proof
- "Innovative" → Show, don't tell
- "Seamless" → How exactly?

**The Restaurant Test**: Would you say this to a friend over dinner?

### Lead with POV, Not Product

**Structure**:
1. Bold statement: "Marketing automation is killing marketing"
2. Validate: "When was the last email that felt personal?"
3. Your take: "We built something different..."
4. Proof: Show how

### Show the Cost of Inaction

Not: "Increase productivity"
But: "Your team wastes 12 hours/week on status updates"

Not: "Better security"
But: "The average breach costs $4.35M and 6 months of cleanup"

---

## VIII. EVALUATION FRAMEWORK

### The Honest Tests (Run Before Launch)

**1. The Ignore Test**
If you saw this in feed, would you scroll past?

**2. The Competitor Test**
Could competitor run this with their logo?

**3. The Dinner Test**
Would you say this to colleague over dinner?

**4. The Detail Test**
Does this include specific, concrete details?

**5. The Feeling Test**
Does this make you feel something?

### The Three-Question Framework

**1. What's the single human truth?**
(Not positioning, actual human insight)

**2. What's the one thing we want people to feel/think?**
(Not "credible and professional")

**3. What makes this worth sharing?**
(Insight, humor, utility, identification—not self-promotion)

### Common Failure Patterns

**1. Everything for Everyone**
Symptom: Feature laundry list, multiple CTAs
Fix: One ad, one message, one audience

**2. Credibility Overload**
Symptom: Every ad mentions awards, years, client count
Fix: Lead with value, use credibility as proof

**3. Abstract Benefits**
Symptom: "Empower, Transform, Optimize" without specifics
Fix: Show before/after in concrete terms

**4. Feature Dump**
Symptom: List of capabilities without context
Fix: Pick one feature, show why it matters

**5. Stock Photo Syndrome**
Symptom: Generic business imagery
Fix: Real customers, real product, or bold illustration

**6. Playing it Safe**
Symptom: Forgettable, makes no choice
Fix: Have POV, take stand, be memorable

---

## IX. CATEGORY-SPECIFIC PLAYBOOKS

### SaaS/Tech
**Trap**: Feature lists, integration logos, security badges
**Opportunity**: Show experience, transformation, philosophy

**Winning Approaches**:
- Product-led storytelling (show interface magic)
- Founder-led POV (build trust)
- Customer voice (real messages/tweets)
- Simplified demos that feel magical

### Professional Services
**Trap**: "Strategic partners," stock photos, vague promises
**Opportunity**: Demonstrate thinking, build authority

**Winning Approaches**:
- Original research (own a space)
- Transparent methodology (show how you work)
- Team personality (introduce humans)
- Specific success metrics ($2.3M pipeline in 90 days)

### Enterprise Software
**Trap**: IT-speak, compliance checklists, vendor tables
**Opportunity**: End-user experience, business outcomes

**Winning Approaches**:
- Bottom-up narrative (how it spreads)
- Cost of status quo (make inertia painful)
- Executive win (what C-suite cares about)
- Integration storytelling (make other tools better)

## XI. FINAL PRINCIPLES

### Remember

**The biggest risk in B2B advertising isn't being too bold, too funny, or too different.**

**The biggest risk is being invisible.**

Generic, safe, corporate-speak doesn't protect your brand. It suffocates it.

### Your Job

Your job isn't to sound like everyone else in your category.

Your job is to make people:
- Feel something
- Remember something
- Choose you

### Optimize For

You are not optimizing for safety.
You are optimizing for memorability.

The companies that break through remember: B2B buyers are humans first. They want entertainment, emotion, and inspiration—just like everyone else.

Now go make something brave.
