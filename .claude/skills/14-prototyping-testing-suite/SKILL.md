# Prototyping & Testing

## Fidelity Levels

**Low-Fi:** Paper sketches, wireframes (quick validation)
**Mid-Fi:** Clickable prototypes, basic interactions (flow testing)
**High-Fi:** Polished UI, realistic content (final validation)

## Prototype Testing

**Test Plan:**
1. Objectives: What are you validating?
2. Participants: Who and how many?
3. Tasks: What should they do?
4. Metrics: How measure success?
5. Questions: What to ask?

**Facilitation:**
- Think-aloud protocol
- Observe, don't lead
- Note pain points and delights
- Record with permission

## Beta Program

**Phases:**
- Alpha: Internal testing
- Closed Beta: Select users
- Open Beta: Public access
- General Availability

**Structure:**
- Clear goals and timeline
- Feedback channels
- Regular communication
- Incentives (early access, credits)
