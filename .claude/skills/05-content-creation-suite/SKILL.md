Principle: Make it friendly and show next action
```

## Writing Best Practices

### General Principles
1. **Clarity over cleverness**: Be clear first, clever second
2. **Front-load value**: Put important info first
3. **Active voice**: "We launched" not "it was launched"
4. **Specific over generic**: Numbers, examples, concrete details
5. **One idea per sentence**: Easy to scan and understand
6. **Cut ruthlessly**: Every word must earn its place
7. **Read aloud**: If it sounds awkward, rewrite it

### Hook Formulas
- **Question**: "Want to know the secret to...?"
- **Stat**: "87% of marketers make this mistake..."
- **Story**: "Last week, I almost lost our biggest client..."
- **Bold claim**: "Everything you know about X is wrong"
- **Curiosity gap**: "The one thing that changed everything..."
- **Relatability**: "We've all been there: [common situation]..."

### Call-to-Action (CTA) Guidelines
- Make it specific and actionable
- Use strong action verbs
- Create urgency when appropriate
- Show the benefit clearly
- Make it visually prominent

**Examples:**
- ❌ "Learn more"
- ✓ "Get your free template"
- ✓ "Start your 14-day trial"
- ✓ "Download the guide"
