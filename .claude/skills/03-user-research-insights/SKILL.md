# User Research Insights

Transform user research into actionable product insights and opportunity identification.

## Research Analysis Framework

### 1. Research Synthesis Process

**Step-by-Step:**
1. **Collect & Organize**: Gather all research data (interviews, surveys, analytics, feedback)
2. **Tag & Code**: Identify themes, patterns, pain points, and quotes
3. **Cluster**: Group similar findings into categories
4. **Prioritize**: Rank insights by frequency, severity, and business impact
5. **Extract**: Create actionable insights with supporting evidence
6. **Validate**: Cross-check findings across multiple sources

**Insight Template:**
```
Insight: [Clear statement of what you learned]

Evidence:
- Source 1: [Quote or data point]
- Source 2: [Quote or data point]
- Source 3: [Quote or data point]

Frequency: [How often this came up]
Severity: [How painful is this problem? 1-10]
Affected Users: [Who experiences this?]

Implications:
- [What this means for the product]
- [Potential solution directions]

Priority: [High/Medium/Low]
Confidence: [High/Medium/Low based on data quality]
```

### 2. User Persona Creation

**Persona Components:**

**Demographics & Background:**
- Name and photo (representative, not real user)
- Age, location, occupation
- Education and technical proficiency
- Role and responsibilities

**Behavioral Patterns:**
- Goals and motivations
- Pain points and frustrations
- Current solutions and workarounds
- Daily workflow and context

**Product Relationship:**
- How they use our product/category
- Frequency and intensity of use
- Feature preferences
- Success criteria

**Psychographics:**
- Attitudes and beliefs
- Decision-making factors
- Communication preferences
- Influential factors

**Persona Template:**
```

```

**Creating Multiple Personas:**
- Primary persona: Most common, highest value
- Secondary personas: Significant but different needs
- Anti-persona: Who we're NOT building for

### 3. Customer Journey Mapping

**Journey Map Structure:**

**Stages:**
1. Awareness (discovering the problem/need)
2. Consideration (evaluating solutions)
3. Purchase/Adoption (choosing and onboarding)
4. Usage (ongoing interaction)
5. Renewal/Expansion (continued value)

**For Each Stage, Capture:**
- **Actions**: What the user does
- **Touchpoints**: Where they interact with us
- **Thoughts**: What they're thinking
- **Emotions**: How they feel (plot on emotion curve)
- **Pain Points**: Frustrations and obstacles
- **Opportunities**: How we can improve

**Journey Map Template:**
```
Stage: [e.g., Consideration]

User Actions:
- [Action 1]
- [Action 2]

Touchpoints:
- [Website, app, support, etc.]

Thoughts:
- "[What user is thinking]"

Emotions: [😊 😐 😞] (plot emotion level)

Pain Points:
- [Friction 1] - Severity: [High/Medium/Low]
- [Friction 2] - Severity: [High/Medium/Low]

Opportunities:
- [Improvement 1]
- [Improvement 2]

Current Experience: [1-10]
Target Experience: [1-10]
```

### 4. Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD) Framework

**JTBD Core Principle:**
People don't buy products; they hire them to make progress in specific circumstances.

**JTBD Statement Format:**
"When [situation], I want to [motivation], so I can [expected outcome]."

**Example:**
"When I'm running late in the morning, I want to grab a convenient breakfast, so I can stay energized without delaying my commute."

**JTBD Analysis Template:**
```
Job Statement:
When [situation/circumstance]
I want to [motivation/goal]
So I can [desired outcome]

Job Context:
- Situation: [When does this job arise?]
- Frequency: [How often?]
- Alternatives: [What do people hire instead?]
- Anxiety: [What concerns do they have?]

Success Criteria:
- Functional: [What needs to work?]
- Emotional: [How should they feel?]
- Social: [How does this affect their image?]

Current Solutions:
- Solution 1: [Pros and cons]
- Solution 2: [Pros and cons]

Opportunity:
- Underserved needs: [What current solutions don't do well]
- Our unique angle: [How we can do it better]
```

**Types of Jobs:**
- **Main Job**: Core functional job (e.g., "get from A to B")
- **Related Jobs**: Jobs connected to the main job (e.g., "listen to music while commuting")
- **Emotional Jobs**: How people want to feel (e.g., "feel productive")
- **Social Jobs**: How people want to be perceived (e.g., "appear professional")

### 5. Opportunity Identification

**Opportunity Framework:**

**Signal Types:**
- **High-frequency pain points**: Mentioned by many users
- **High-severity pain points**: Deeply frustrating, even if less common
- **Unmet needs**: Things users want but can't do
- **Workarounds**: Complex hacks users create
- **Competitive gaps**: What competitors don't offer
- **Emerging behaviors**: New patterns forming

**Opportunity Template:**
```
Opportunity: [Concise description]

User Need:
[What users are trying to accomplish]

Current State:
[How users handle this today]

Pain Points:
- [Problem 1] - Frequency: [%], Severity: [1-10]
- [Problem 2] - Frequency: [%], Severity: [1-10]

Evidence:
- [Research finding 1]
- [Research finding 2]
- [Data point]

Potential Solution:
[High-level approach]

Impact If Solved:
- Users affected: [Number/percentage]
- Value delivered: [Time saved, money saved, satisfaction increase]
- Competitive advantage: [How this differentiates us]

Effort Estimate: [T-shirt size: S/M/L/XL]
Priority Score: [Based on framework]
```

## Research Quality Checklist

✓ **Representative Sample**: Covers diverse user segments
✓ **Sufficient Depth**: Enough detail to understand context
✓ **Triangulation**: Multiple sources confirm findings
✓ **Actionable Insights**: Clear implications for product
✓ **Quantified**: Numbers on frequency, severity where possible
✓ **Contextualized**: Understand the 'why' behind behaviors
✓ **Validated**: Cross-checked with other data (analytics, sales, etc.)

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Confirmation bias**: Only seeing evidence that supports existing beliefs
- **Leading questions**: Asking questions that suggest the answer
- **Small sample**: Drawing conclusions from too few participants
- **Recency bias**: Overweighting latest feedback
- **Feature requests as insights**: Taking solutions instead of understanding problems
- **Ignoring outliers**: Dismissing edge cases that might signal emerging needs
