## 3. Storytelling Frameworks

### The Hero's Journey (for narratives)

```

### Story Spine (Quick Stories)
```
Once upon a time, [setup]
Every day, [status quo]
But one day, [inciting incident]
Because of that, [consequence]
Because of that, [escalation]
Until finally, [climax]
And ever since, [resolution]
```

### Customer Story Template

## 4. Persuasive Copywriting Frameworks

### AIDA Framework
```
Attention: [Grab attention with bold claim or question]
"Most teams waste 40% of their time in unproductive meetings."

Interest: [Build interest with relevant details]
"Imagine if you could reclaim those hours for deep work—without endless back-and-forths or scheduling headaches."

Desire: [Create desire by showing transformation]
"With [Product], teams reduce meeting time by 60% while improving alignment. No more scheduling tennis, no more unclear action items."

Action: [Clear call to action]
"Start your free 14-day trial. No credit card required."
```

### PAS Framework (Problem-Agitate-Solution)
```
Problem: [State the problem clearly]
"You're losing qualified leads because your website doesn't load fast enough."

Agitate: [Make the problem feel urgent]
"Every second of delay costs you 7% in conversions. That's thousands in lost revenue monthly. Your competitors with faster sites are winning customers that should be yours."

Solution: [Present your solution]
"[Product] optimizes your site performance automatically. Get sub-2-second load times without hiring developers. Increase conversions by up to 35%."
```

### FAB Framework (Features-Advantages-Benefits)
```
Feature: What it is
"Built-in collaboration tools"

Advantage: What it does
"Allows teams to comment and edit in real-time"

Benefit: What it means for them
"So you can ship products 2x faster without endless email threads"

Combined:
"With built-in collaboration tools, your team can comment and edit in real-time, shipping products 2x faster without endless email threads."
```

### Before-After-Bridge
```
Before: [Their current painful state]
"You're manually tracking customer data in spreadsheets, losing deals in the cracks, and spending hours on admin work."

After: [The ideal transformed state]
"Imagine all customer data in one place, automatic follow-ups, and pipelines that practically manage themselves."

Bridge: [How to get there]

```

## 5. Headline Optimization

### Headline Formulas

**Numbers:**

**Promise:**

### Headline Testing

**4 U's Formula:**

- Urgent: Does it convey timeliness?
- Unique: Is it different from competition?
- Ultra-specific: Is it concrete and clear?

**Example Optimization:**
❌ "Our New Feature"
- Useful: No | Urgent: No | Unique: No | Ultra-specific: No

✅ "Cut Email Response Time by 50% with Smart Templates"
- Useful: Yes | Urgent: Implied | Unique: Yes | Ultra-specific: Yes

## 6. Messaging Hierarchy

[Subheadline]: Expand on the benefit (20 words)
[Proof Point 1]: Supporting evidence or feature
[Proof Point 2]: Supporting evidence or feature
[Proof Point 3]: Supporting evidence or feature
```

**Example:**
```

Subheadline: Automatically generate specs, track dependencies, and keep stakeholders aligned—all in one workspace.
• Eliminate 10+ hours of manual documentation weekly
• Smart templates that adapt to your product workflow

```

### Elevator Pitch (30 seconds)
```

Unlike [competition]
