# Product Strategy Framework

Strategic frameworks and mental models for product decision-making.

## Core Frameworks

### 1. Opportunity Evaluation

**Evaluation Criteria:**
- **Market Size**: TAM, SAM, SOM analysis
- **Problem Severity**: How painful is the problem? (1-10 scale)
- **Solution Fit**: How well does our solution address the problem?
- **Competitive Advantage**: What's our unique edge?
- **Strategic Alignment**: Does it support our vision and OKRs?
- **Resource Requirements**: Can we build/maintain this?
- **Time to Value**: How quickly can we deliver impact?

**Opportunity Scoring Template:**
```
Opportunity: [Name]
Market Size: [$ or users]
Problem Severity: [1-10]
Our Fit: [1-10]
Competitive Edge: [Description]
Resources Needed: [Team, time, budget]
Strategic Score: [Calculate weighted score]

Decision: Go / No-Go / Revisit Later
```

### 2. Feature Prioritization Frameworks

#### RICE Framework
- **Reach**: How many users will this impact? (per quarter)
- **Impact**: How much will this improve their experience? (0.25 = minimal, 3 = massive)
- **Confidence**: How certain are we? (50%, 80%, 100%)
- **Effort**: How many person-months will this take?

**RICE Score = (Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort**

**Example:**
```
Feature: Advanced search filters
Reach: 5,000 users/quarter
Impact: 2 (high improvement)
Confidence: 80%
Effort: 3 person-months
RICE Score = (5,000 × 2 × 0.8) / 3 = 2,667
```

#### Value vs Effort Matrix
Plot features on 2x2 matrix:
- **Quick Wins** (High Value, Low Effort) - Do first
- **Big Bets** (High Value, High Effort) - Plan carefully
- **Fill-ins** (Low Value, Low Effort) - Do if capacity
- **Money Pits** (Low Value, High Effort) - Avoid

#### KANO Model
Categorize features by user satisfaction impact:
- **Basic/Must-Have**: Expected, dissatisfaction if missing
- **Performance/Linear**: More is better, competitive differentiators
- **Delighters/Excitement**: Unexpected features that wow users
- **Indifferent**: Users don't care
- **Reverse**: Some users prefer NOT having this

**Prioritization Strategy:**
1. Must-Haves: Table stakes, must include
2. Performance: Prioritize based on competitive landscape
3. Delighters: Include 1-2 to stand out
4. Indifferent/Reverse: Deprioritize or remove

### 3. Competitive Analysis

**Analysis Framework:**
```
Competitor: [Name]

Positioning:
- Target Market: [Who they serve]
- Value Proposition: [Their unique angle]
- Pricing: [Model and tiers]

Product Analysis:
- Key Features: [What they do well]
- Gaps: [What they're missing]
- UX Strengths: [User experience wins]
- UX Weaknesses: [User experience losses]

Market Position:
- Market Share: [Percentage or users]
- Growth Rate: [Trend]
- Customer Sentiment: [Reviews, NPS]

Our Advantages:
- [What we do better]

Our Weaknesses:
- [Where they beat us]

Strategic Response:
- [How we should compete]
```

**Competitive Positioning Map:**
Create 2×2 matrix with relevant axes (e.g., Price vs Features, Ease of Use vs Power, etc.)

### 4. Go-to-Market (GTM) Planning

**GTM Strategy Components:**

**1. Market & Customer:**
- Target segment definition
- Buyer personas (decision maker, influencer, user)
- Customer journey mapping

**2. Positioning & Messaging:**
- Value proposition statement
- Key differentiators (vs competitors)
- Messaging framework (headline, benefits, proof points)
- Elevator pitch (30 seconds)

**3. Pricing Strategy:**
- Pricing model (subscription, usage-based, freemium, etc.)
- Price points and tiers
- Competitive pricing analysis
- Value metric (what customers pay for)

**4. Launch Plan:**
- Beta/early access program
- Launch date and milestones
- Marketing channels (content, paid, partnerships)
- Sales enablement (training, collateral)
- Success metrics and goals

**GTM Template:**
```
# GTM Plan: [Product/Feature]

## 1. Target Market
- Primary: [Detailed description]
- Secondary: [Detailed description]
- ICP (Ideal Customer Profile): [Firmographic and behavioral]

## 2. Positioning
- Problem: [What pain we solve]
- Solution: [How we solve it]
- Differentiation: [Why us vs competitors]
- Proof: [Customer results, data points]

## 3. Pricing
- Model: [How we charge]
- Tiers: [Free, Starter, Pro, Enterprise]
- Justification: [Value delivered at each tier]

## 4. Channel Strategy
- Awareness: [SEO, content, ads, PR]
- Consideration: [Demo, trials, case studies]
- Decision: [Sales process, pricing page]
- Retention: [Onboarding, support, expansion]

## 5. Launch Timeline
- Week 1-2: [Activities]
- Week 3-4: [Activities]
- Month 2-3: [Activities]

## 6. Success Metrics
- Acquisition: [Target signups, MQLs]
- Activation: [Target activation rate]
- Revenue: [Target ARR, conversion rate]
- Adoption: [Target DAU, feature usage]
```

### 5. North Star Metric & Analytics

**North Star Metric Selection:**
A single metric that best captures core value delivered to customers.

**Criteria:**
- Represents customer value (not just business value)
- Measurable and trackable
- Leading indicator of growth
- Influenced by the product team

**Examples:**
- Slack: Messages sent per user
- Airbnb: Nights booked
- Netflix: Watch time
- Shopify: GMV (Gross Merchandise Value)

**Metric Framework:**
```
North Star Metric: [The one metric that matters]

Supporting Metrics:
- Acquisition: [How users discover us]
- Activation: [Aha moment metric]
- Engagement: [Core action frequency]
- Retention: [% returning users]
- Revenue: [$ per user]

Counter Metrics:
- [Metrics to ensure we're not gaming the system]

Tracking:
- Current: [Value]
- Goal: [Target]
- Timeframe: [When to achieve]
```

### 6. Product-Led Growth (PLG) Strategy

**PLG Principles:**
1. Product is the main acquisition channel
2. Users can experience value before purchasing
3. Viral loops and network effects built in
4. Friction minimized in onboarding
5. Data-driven optimization

**PLG Tactics:**
- Freemium or generous free trial
- Self-service signup and onboarding
- Time-to-value < 5 minutes
- Built-in sharing/collaboration features
- Usage-based pricing aligned with value
- In-product upgrade prompts at moments of value

## Strategic Thinking Prompts

**When evaluating opportunities:**
- What problem are we uniquely positioned to solve?
- What would have to be true for this to be a 10x win?
- What's the simplest version that delivers value?
- How does this compound or open future opportunities?

**When prioritizing features:**
- Does this move our north star metric?
- Would we build this if we had unlimited resources?
- What would we do if we had half the time?
- What's the 20% that delivers 80% of value?

**When facing competition:**
- Can we win by being different vs better?
- What would Amazon/Google/Apple do? (Then do different)
- Where is our competitor weak by design?
- Can we make their strength irrelevant?

**When planning launches:**
- Who will care about this day one?
- What's the smallest remarkable version?
- How will users discover this organically?
- What could go wrong, and how do we mitigate?

## Best Practices

1. **Think in Bets**: Frame decisions as bets with expected value
2. **Use Mental Models**: Second-order thinking, Pareto principle, opportunity cost
3. **Validate Assumptions**: Test riskiest assumptions first
4. **Stay Lean**: MVP, iterate based on data
5. **Customer-First**: Strategy serves customer needs, not internal preferences
6. **Document Reasoning**: Write down your thinking for future reference
7. **Review and Adapt**: Quarterly strategy reviews, pivot when needed
